MariaDB Tools are a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
[MariaDB](http://www.mariadb.com/)) support staff to perform a variety
of MariaDB database and system tasks that are too difficult or complex
to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or \"one-off\" scripts,
because they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully
documented. They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick
and easy, and no libraries are installed.

MariaDB Tools were derived from MariaDB scripts, Percona Toolkit,
Maatkit, PalaminoDB Tools and Aspersa, some of the best-known toolkits
for MariaDB server administration. It is developed and supported by
MariaDB.
