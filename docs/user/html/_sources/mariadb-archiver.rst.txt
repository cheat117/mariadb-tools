.. program:: mariadb-archiver

===========================
:program:`mariadb-archiver`
===========================

NAME
====

:program:`mariadb-archiver` - Archive rows from a MariaDB table into another table or a file.

SYNOPSIS
========

Usage
-----

::

  mariadb-archiver [OPTIONS] --source DSN --where WHERE

:program:`mariadb-archiver` nibbles records from a MariaDB table.  The --source and --dest
arguments use DSN syntax; if COPY is yes, --dest defaults to the key's value
from --source.

Examples
--------

Archive all rows from oltp_server to olap_server and to a file:

.. code-block:: bash

   mariadb-archiver --source h=oltp_server,D=test,t=tbl --dest h=olap_server \
     --file '/var/log/archive/%Y-%m-%d-%D.%t'                           \
     --where "1=1" --limit 1000 --commit-each

Purge (delete) orphan rows from child table:

.. code-block:: bash

   mariadb-archiver --source h=host,D=db,t=child --purge \
     --where 'NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM parent WHERE col=child.col)'

RISKS
=====

:program:`mariadb-archiver` is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Review the tool's known "BUGS"

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-archiver` is the tool I use to archive tables as described in
`http://tinyurl.com/mysql-archiving <http://tinyurl.com/mysql-archiving>`_.  The goal is a low-impact, forward-only
job to nibble old data out of the table without impacting OLTP queries much.
You can insert the data into another table, which need not be on the same
server.  You can also write it to a file in a format suitable for LOAD DATA
INFILE.  Or you can do neither, in which case it's just an incremental DELETE.

:program:`mariadb-archiver` is extensible via a plugin mechanism.  You can inject your own
code to add advanced archiving logic that could be useful for archiving
dependent data, applying complex business rules, or building a data warehouse
during the archiving process.

You need to choose values carefully for some options.  The most important are
:option:`--limit`, :option:`--retries`, and :option:`--txn-size`.

The strategy is to find the first row(s), then scan some index forward-only to
find more rows efficiently.  Each subsequent query should not scan the entire
table; it should seek into the index, then scan until it finds more archivable
rows.  Specifying the index with the 'i' part of the :option:`--source` argument can
be crucial for this; use :option:`--dry-run` to examine the generated queries and be
sure to EXPLAIN them to see if they are efficient (most of the time you probably
want to scan the PRIMARY key, which is the default).  Even better, examine the
difference in the Handler status counters before and after running the query,
and make sure it is not scanning the whole table every query.

You can disable the seek-then-scan optimizations partially or wholly with
:option:`--no-ascend` and :option:`--ascend-first`.  Sometimes this may be more efficient
for multi-column keys.  Be aware that :program:`mariadb-archiver` is built to start at the
beginning of the index it chooses and scan it forward-only.  This might result
in long table scans if you're trying to nibble from the end of the table by an
index other than the one it prefers.  See :option:`--source` and read the
documentation on the ``i`` part if this applies to you.

MariaDB Galera Cluster
======================

:program:`mariadb-archiver` works with MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.1 and newer,
but there are three limitations you should consider before archiving on
a cluster:

Error on commit

 :program:`mariadb-archiver` does not check for error when it commits transactions.
 Commits on Galera can fail, but the tool does not yet check for or retry the
 transaction when this happens.  If it happens, the tool will die.

MyISAM tables

 Archiving MyISAM tables works, but MyISAM support in Galera is still
 experimental at the time of this release.  There are several known bugs with
 Galera, MyISAM tables, and ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` columns.  Therefore, you must ensure
 that archiving will not directly or indirectly result in the use of default
 ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` values for a MyISAM table.  For example, this happens with
 :option:`--dest` if :option:`--columns` is used and the ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` column is not
 included.  The tool does not check for this!

Non-cluster options

 Certain options may or may not work.  For example, if a cluster node
 is not also a slave, then :option:`--check-slave-lag` does not work.  And since Galera
 tables are usually InnoDB, but InnoDB doesn't support ``INSERT DELAYED``, then
 :option:`--delayed-insert` does not work.  Other options may also not work, but
 the tool does not check them, therefore you should test archiving on a test
 cluster before archiving on your real cluster.

OUTPUT
======

If you specify :option:`--progress`, the output is a header row, plus status output
at intervals.  Each row in the status output lists the current date and time,
how many seconds :program:`mariadb-archiver` has been running, and how many rows it has
archived.

If you specify :option:`--statistics`, :program:`mariadb-archiver` outputs timing and other
information to help you identify which part of your archiving process takes the
most time.

ERROR-HANDLING
==============

:program:`mariadb-archiver` tries to catch signals and exit gracefully; for example, if you
send it SIGTERM (Ctrl-C on UNIX-ish systems), it will catch the signal, print a
message about the signal, and exit fairly normally.  It will not execute
:option:`--analyze` or :option:`--optimize`, because these may take a long time to finish.
It will run all other code normally, including calling after_finish() on any
plugins (see "EXTENDING").

In other words, a signal, if caught, will break out of the main archiving
loop and skip optimize/analyze.

OPTIONS
=======

Specify at least one of :option:`--dest`, :option:`--file`, or :option:`--purge`.

:option:`--ignore` and :option:`--replace` are mutually exclusive.

:option:`--txn-size` and :option:`--commit-each` are mutually exclusive.

:option:`--low-priority-insert` and :option:`--delayed-insert` are mutually exclusive.

:option:`--share-lock` and :option:`--for-update` are mutually exclusive.

:option:`--analyze` and :option:`--optimize` are mutually exclusive.

:option:`--no-ascend` and :option:`--no-delete` are mutually exclusive.

DSN values in :option:`--dest` default to values from :option:`--source` if COPY is yes.

.. option:: --analyze

 type: string

 Run ANALYZE TABLE afterwards on :option:`--source` and/or :option:`--dest`.

 Runs ANALYZE TABLE after finishing.  The argument is an arbitrary string.  If it
 contains the letter 's', the source will be analyzed.  If it contains 'd', the
 destination will be analyzed.  You can specify either or both.  For example, the
 following will analyze both:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --analyze=ds

 See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/analyze-table/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/analyze-table/>`_ for details on ANALYZE
 TABLE.

.. option:: --ascend-first

 Ascend only first column of index.

 If you do want to use the ascending index optimization (see :option:`--no-ascend`),
 but do not want to incur the overhead of ascending a large multi-column index,
 you can use this option to tell :program:`mariadb-archiver` to ascend only the leftmost column
 of the index.  This can provide a significant performance boost over not
 ascending the index at all, while avoiding the cost of ascending the whole
 index.

 See "EXTENDING" for a discussion of how this interacts with plugins.

.. option:: --ask-pass

 Prompt for a password when connecting to MariaDB.

.. option:: --buffer

 Buffer output to :option:`--file` and flush at commit.

 Disables autoflushing to :option:`--file` and flushes :option:`--file` to disk only when a
 transaction commits.  This typically means the file is block-flushed by the
 operating system, so there may be some implicit flushes to disk between
 commits as well.  The default is to flush :option:`--file` to disk after every row.

 The danger is that a crash might cause lost data.

 The performance increase I have seen from using :option:`--buffer` is around 5 to 15
 percent.  Your mileage may vary.

.. option:: --bulk-delete

 Delete each chunk with a single statement (implies :option:`--commit-each`).

 Delete each chunk of rows in bulk with a single ``DELETE`` statement.  The
 statement deletes every row between the first and last row of the chunk,
 inclusive.  It implies :option:`--commit-each`, since it would be a bad idea to
 ``INSERT`` rows one at a time and commit them before the bulk ``DELETE``.

 The normal method is to delete every row by its primary key.  Bulk deletes might
 be a lot faster.  **They also might not be faster** if you have a complex
 ``WHERE`` clause.

 This option completely defers all ``DELETE`` processing until the chunk of rows
 is finished.  If you have a plugin on the source, its ``before_delete`` method
 will not be called.  Instead, its ``before_bulk_delete`` method is called later.

 **WARNING**: if you have a plugin on the source that sometimes doesn't return
 true from ``is_archivable()``, you should use this option only if you understand
 what it does.  If the plugin instructs :program:`mariadb-archiver` not to archive a row,
 it will still be deleted by the bulk delete!

.. option:: --[no]bulk-delete-limit

 default: yes

 Add :option:`--limit` to :option:`--bulk-delete` statement.

 This is an advanced option and you should not disable it unless you know what
 you are doing and why!  By default, :option:`--bulk-delete` appends a :option:`--limit`
 clause to the bulk delete SQL statement.  In certain cases, this clause can be
 omitted by specifying ``--no-bulk-delete-limit``.  :option:`--limit` must still be
 specified.

.. option:: --bulk-insert

 Insert each chunk with LOAD DATA INFILE (implies :option:`--bulk-delete` :option:`--commit-each`).

 Insert each chunk of rows with ``LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE``.  This may be much
 faster than inserting a row at a time with ``INSERT`` statements.  It is
 implemented by creating a temporary file for each chunk of rows, and writing the
 rows to this file instead of inserting them.  When the chunk is finished, it
 uploads the rows.

 To protect the safety of your data, this option forces bulk deletes to be used.
 It would be unsafe to delete each row as it is found, before inserting the rows
 into the destination first.  Forcing bulk deletes guarantees that the deletion
 waits until the insertion is successful.

 The :option:`--low-priority-insert`, :option:`--replace`, and :option:`--ignore` options work
 with this option, but :option:`--delayed-insert` does not.

 If ``LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`` throws an error in the lines of ``The used
 command is not allowed with this MariaDB version``, refer to the documentation
 for the ``L`` DSN option.

.. option:: --channel

 type: string

 Channel name used when connected to a server using replication channels.
 Suppose you have two masters, master_a at port 12345, master_b at port 1236 and
 a slave connected to both masters using channels chan_master_a and chan_master_b.
 If you want to run :program:`mariadb-archiver` to syncronize the slave against master_a, :program:`mariadb-archiver`
 won't be able to determine what's the correct master since SHOW SLAVE STATUS
 will return 2 rows. In this case, you can use --channel=chan_master_a to specify
 the channel name to use in the SHOW SLAVE STATUS command.

.. option:: --charset

 short form: -A; type: string

 Default character set.  If the value is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on
 STDOUT to utf8, passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET
 NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MariaDB.  Any other value sets binmode on STDOUT
 without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MariaDB.

 Note that only charsets as known by MariaDB are recognized; So for example,
 "UTF8" will work, but "UTF-8" will not.

 See also :option:`--[no]check-charset`.

.. option:: --[no]check-charset

 default: yes

 Ensure connection and table character sets are the same.  Disabling this check
 may cause text to be erroneously converted from one character set to another
 (usually from utf8 to latin1) which may cause data loss or mojibake.  Disabling
 this check may be useful or necessary when character set conversions are
 intended.

.. option:: --[no]check-columns

 default: yes

 Ensure :option:`--source` and :option:`--dest` have same columns.

 Enabled by default; causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to check that the source and destination
 tables have the same columns.  It does not check column order, data type, etc.
 It just checks that all columns in the source exist in the destination and
 vice versa.  If there are any differences, :program:`mariadb-archiver` will exit with an
 error.

 To disable this check, specify --no-check-columns.

.. option:: --check-interval

 type: time; default: 1s

 If :option:`--check-slave-lag` is given, this defines how long the tool pauses each 
  time it discovers that a slave is lagging.
  This check is performed every 100 rows.

.. option:: --check-slave-lag

 type: string; repeatable: yes

 Pause archiving until the specified DSN's slave lag is less than :option:`--max-lag`.
 This option can be specified multiple times for checking more than one slave.

.. option:: --columns

 short form: -c; type: array

 Comma-separated list of columns to archive.

 Specify a comma-separated list of columns to fetch, write to the file, and
 insert into the destination table.  If specified, :program:`mariadb-archiver` ignores other
 columns unless it needs to add them to the ``SELECT`` statement for ascending an
 index or deleting rows.  It fetches and uses these extra columns internally, but
 does not write them to the file or to the destination table.  It *does* pass
 them to plugins.

 See also :option:`--primary-key-only`.

.. option:: --commit-each

 Commit each set of fetched and archived rows (disables :option:`--txn-size`).

 Commits transactions and flushes :option:`--file` after each set of rows has been
 archived, before fetching the next set of rows, and before sleeping if
 :option:`--sleep` is specified.  Disables :option:`--txn-size`; use :option:`--limit` to
 control the transaction size with :option:`--commit-each`.

 This option is useful as a shortcut to make :option:`--limit` and :option:`--txn-size` the
 same value, but more importantly it avoids transactions being held open while
 searching for more rows.  For example, imagine you are archiving old rows from
 the beginning of a very large table, with :option:`--limit` 1000 and :option:`--txn-size`
 1000.  After some period of finding and archiving 1000 rows at a time,
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` finds the last 999 rows and archives them, then executes the next
 SELECT to find more rows.  This scans the rest of the table, but never finds any
 more rows.  It has held open a transaction for a very long time, only to
 determine it is finished anyway.  You can use :option:`--commit-each` to avoid this.

.. option:: --config

 type: Array

 Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the
 first option on the command line.

.. option:: --database

 short form: -D; type: string

 Connect to this database.

.. option:: --delayed-insert

 Add the DELAYED modifier to INSERT statements.

 Adds the DELAYED modifier to INSERT or REPLACE statements.  See
 `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/insert/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/insert/>`_ for details.

.. option:: --dest

 type: DSN

 DSN specifying the table to archive to.

 This item specifies a table into which :program:`mariadb-archiver` will insert rows
 archived from :option:`--source`.  It uses the same key=val argument format as
 :option:`--source`.  Most missing values default to the same values as
 :option:`--source`, so you don't have to repeat options that are the same in
 :option:`--source` and :option:`--dest`.  Use the :option:`--help` option to see which values
 are copied from :option:`--source`.

 **WARNING**: Using a default options file (F) DSN option that defines a
 socket for :option:`--source` causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to connect to :option:`--dest` using
 that socket unless another socket for :option:`--dest` is specified.  This
 means that :program:`mariadb-archiver` may incorrectly connect to :option:`--source` when it
 connects to :option:`--dest`.  For example:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --source F=host1.cnf,D=db,t=tbl --dest h=host2

 When :program:`mariadb-archiver` connects to :option:`--dest`, host2, it will connect via the
 :option:`--source`, host1, socket defined in host1.cnf.

.. option:: --dry-run

 Print queries and exit without doing anything.

 Causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to exit after printing the filename and SQL statements
 it will use.

.. option:: --file

 type: string

 File to archive to, with DATE_FORMAT()-like formatting.

 Filename to write archived rows to.  A subset of MariaDB's DATE_FORMAT()
 formatting codes are allowed in the filename, as follows:

 .. code-block:: bash

     %d    Day of the month, numeric (01..31)
     %H    Hour (00..23)
     %i    Minutes, numeric (00..59)
     %m    Month, numeric (01..12)
     %s    Seconds (00..59)
     %Y    Year, numeric, four digits

 You can use the following extra format codes too:

 .. code-block:: bash

     %D    Database name
     %t    Table name

 Example:

 .. code-block:: bash

     --file '/var/log/archive/%Y-%m-%d-%D.%t'

 The file's contents are in the same format used by SELECT INTO OUTFILE, as
 documented in the MariaDB manual: rows terminated by newlines, columns
 terminated by tabs, NULL characters are represented by \N, and special
 characters are escaped by \.  This lets you reload a file with LOAD DATA
 INFILE's default settings.

 If you want a column header at the top of the file, see :option:`--header`.  The file
 is auto-flushed by default; see :option:`--buffer`.

.. option:: --for-update

 Adds the FOR UPDATE modifier to SELECT statements.

 For details, see `http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-locking-reads.html <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-locking-reads.html>`_.

.. option:: --header

 Print column header at top of :option:`--file`.

 Writes column names as the first line in the file given by :option:`--file`.  If the
 file exists, does not write headers; this keeps the file loadable with LOAD
 DATA INFILE in case you append more output to it.

.. option:: --help

 Show help and exit.

.. option:: --high-priority-select

 Adds the HIGH_PRIORITY modifier to SELECT statements.

 See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/select/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/select/>`_ for details.

.. option:: --host

 short form: -h; type: string

 Connect to host.

.. option:: --ignore

 Use IGNORE for INSERT statements.

 Causes INSERTs into :option:`--dest` to be INSERT IGNORE.

.. option:: --limit

 type: int; default: 1

 Number of rows to fetch and archive per statement.

 Limits the number of rows returned by the SELECT statements that retrieve rows
 to archive.  Default is one row.  It may be more efficient to increase the
 limit, but be careful if you are archiving sparsely, skipping over many rows;
 this can potentially cause more contention with other queries, depending on the
 storage engine, transaction isolation level, and options such as
 :option:`--for-update`.

.. option:: --local

 Do not write OPTIMIZE or ANALYZE queries to binlog.

 Adds the NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG modifier to ANALYZE and OPTIMIZE queries.  See
 :option:`--analyze` for details.

.. option:: --low-priority-delete

 Adds the LOW_PRIORITY modifier to DELETE statements.

 See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/delete/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/delete/>`_ for details.

.. option:: --low-priority-insert

 Adds the LOW_PRIORITY modifier to INSERT or REPLACE statements.

 See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/insert/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/insert/>`_ for details.

.. option:: --max-flow-ctl

 type: float

 Somewhat similar to --max-lag but for Galera clusters.
 Check average time cluster spent pausing for Flow Control and make tool pause if 
 it goes over the percentage indicated in the option.
 Default is no Flow Control checking.
 This option is available for Galera versions 5.6 or higher.

.. option:: --max-lag

 type: time; default: 1s

 Pause archiving if the slave given by :option:`--check-slave-lag` lags.

 This option causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to look at the slave every time it's about
 to fetch another row.  If the slave's lag is greater than the option's value,
 or if the slave isn't running (so its lag is NULL), pt-table-checksum sleeps
 for :option:`--check-interval` seconds and then looks at the lag again.  It repeats
 until the slave is caught up, then proceeds to fetch and archive the row.

 This option may eliminate the need for :option:`--sleep` or :option:`--sleep-coef`.

.. option:: --no-ascend

 Do not use ascending index optimization.

 The default ascending-index optimization causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to optimize
 repeated ``SELECT`` queries so they seek into the index where the previous query
 ended, then scan along it, rather than scanning from the beginning of the table
 every time.  This is enabled by default because it is generally a good strategy
 for repeated accesses.

 Large, multiple-column indexes may cause the WHERE clause to be complex enough
 that this could actually be less efficient.  Consider for example a four-column
 PRIMARY KEY on (a, b, c, d).  The WHERE clause to start where the last query
 ended is as follows:

 .. code-block:: bash

     WHERE (a > ?)
        OR (a = ? AND b > ?)
        OR (a = ? AND b = ? AND c > ?)
        OR (a = ? AND b = ? AND c = ? AND d >= ?)

 Populating the placeholders with values uses memory and CPU, adds network
 traffic and parsing overhead, and may make the query harder for MariaDB to
 optimize.  A four-column key isn't a big deal, but a ten-column key in which
 every column allows ``NULL`` might be.

 Ascending the index might not be necessary if you know you are simply removing
 rows from the beginning of the table in chunks, but not leaving any holes, so
 starting at the beginning of the table is actually the most efficient thing to
 do.

 See also :option:`--ascend-first`.  See "EXTENDING" for a discussion of how this
 interacts with plugins.

.. option:: --no-delete

 Do not delete archived rows.

 Causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` not to delete rows after processing them.  This disallows
 :option:`--no-ascend`, because enabling them both would cause an infinite loop.

 If there is a plugin on the source DSN, its ``before_delete`` method is called
 anyway, even though :program:`mariadb-archiver` will not execute the delete.  See
 "EXTENDING" for more on plugins.

.. option:: --optimize

 type: string

 Run OPTIMIZE TABLE afterwards on :option:`--source` and/or :option:`--dest`.

 Runs OPTIMIZE TABLE after finishing.  See :option:`--analyze` for the option syntax
 and `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/optimize-table/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/optimize-table/>`_ for details on OPTIMIZE
 TABLE.

.. option:: --output-format

 type: string

 Used with :option:`--file` to specify the output format.

 Valid formats are:
   dump: MariaDB dump format using tabs as field separator (default)
   csv : Dump rows using ',' as separator and optionally enclosing fields by '"'.
         This format is equivalent to FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'.

.. option:: --password

 short form: -p; type: string

 Password to use when connecting.
 If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash: "exam\,ple"

.. option:: --pid

 type: string

 Create the given PID file.  The tool won't start if the PID file already
 exists and the PID it contains is different than the current PID.  However,
 if the PID file exists and the PID it contains is no longer running, the
 tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
 removed automatically when the tool exits.

.. option:: --plugin

 type: string

 Perl module name to use as a generic plugin.

 Specify the Perl module name of a general-purpose plugin.  It is currently used
 only for statistics (see :option:`--statistics`) and must have ``new()`` and a
 ``statistics()`` method.

 The ``new( src =`` $src, dst => $dst, opts => $o )> method gets the source
 and destination DSNs, and their database connections, just like the
 connection-specific plugins do.  It also gets an OptionParser object (``$o``) for
 accessing command-line options (example: ``$o-``get('purge');>).

 The ``statistics(\%stats, $time)`` method gets a hashref of the statistics
 collected by the archiving job, and the time the whole job started.

.. option:: --port

 short form: -P; type: int

 Port number to use for connection.

.. option:: --primary-key-only

 Primary key columns only.

 A shortcut for specifying :option:`--columns` with the primary key columns.  This is
 an efficiency if you just want to purge rows; it avoids fetching the entire row,
 when only the primary key columns are needed for ``DELETE`` statements.  See also
 :option:`--purge`.

.. option:: --progress

 type: int

 Print progress information every X rows.

 Prints current time, elapsed time, and rows archived every X rows.

.. option:: --purge

 Purge instead of archiving; allows omitting :option:`--file` and :option:`--dest`.

 Allows archiving without a :option:`--file` or :option:`--dest` argument, which is
 effectively a purge since the rows are just deleted.

 If you just want to purge rows, consider specifying the table's primary key
 columns with :option:`--primary-key-only`.  This will prevent fetching all columns
 from the server for no reason.

.. option:: --quick-delete

 Adds the QUICK modifier to DELETE statements.

 See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/delete/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/delete/>`_ for details.  As stated in the
 documentation, in some cases it may be faster to use DELETE QUICK followed by
 OPTIMIZE TABLE.  You can use :option:`--optimize` for this.

.. option:: --quiet

 short form: -q

 Do not print any output, such as for :option:`--statistics`.

 Suppresses normal output, including the output of :option:`--statistics`, but doesn't
 suppress the output from :option:`--why-quit`.

.. option:: --replace

 Causes INSERTs into :option:`--dest` to be written as REPLACE.

.. option:: --retries

 type: int; default: 1

 Number of retries per timeout or deadlock.

 Specifies the number of times :program:`mariadb-archiver` should retry when there is an
 InnoDB lock wait timeout or deadlock.  When retries are exhausted,
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` will exit with an error.

 Consider carefully what you want to happen when you are archiving between a
 mixture of transactional and non-transactional storage engines.  The INSERT to
 :option:`--dest` and DELETE from :option:`--source` are on separate connections, so they
 do not actually participate in the same transaction even if they're on the same
 server.  However, :program:`mariadb-archiver` implements simple distributed transactions in
 code, so commits and rollbacks should happen as desired across the two
 connections.

 At this time I have not written any code to handle errors with transactional
 storage engines other than InnoDB.  Request that feature if you need it.

.. option:: --run-time

 type: time

 Time to run before exiting.

 Optional suffix s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days; if no suffix, s is used.

.. option:: --[no]safe-auto-increment

 default: yes

 Do not archive row with max AUTO_INCREMENT.

 Adds an extra WHERE clause to prevent :program:`mariadb-archiver` from removing the newest
 row when ascending a single-column AUTO_INCREMENT key.  This guards against
 re-using AUTO_INCREMENT values if the server restarts, and is enabled by
 default.

 The extra WHERE clause contains the maximum value of the auto-increment column
 as of the beginning of the archive or purge job.  If new rows are inserted while
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` is running, it will not see them.

.. option:: --sentinel

 type: string; default: /tmp/mariadb-archiver-sentinel

 Exit if this file exists.

 The presence of the file specified by :option:`--sentinel` will cause :program:`mariadb-archiver` to
 stop archiving and exit.  The default is /tmp/mariadb-archiver-sentinel.  You
 might find this handy to stop cron jobs gracefully if necessary.  See also
 :option:`--stop`.

.. option:: --slave-user

 type: string

 Sets the user to be used to connect to the slaves.
 This parameter allows you to have a different user with less privileges on the
 slaves but that user must exist on all slaves.

.. option:: --slave-password

 type: string

 Sets the password to be used to connect to the slaves.
 It can be used with --slave-user and the password for the user must be the same
 on all slaves.

.. option:: --set-vars

 type: Array

 Set the MariaDB variables in this comma-separated list of ``variable=value`` pairs.

 By default, the tool sets:

 .. code-block:: bash

     wait_timeout=10000

 Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For
 example, specifying ``--set-vars wait_timeout=500`` overrides the default
 value of ``10000``.

 The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

.. option:: --share-lock

 Adds the LOCK IN SHARE MODE modifier to SELECT statements.

 See `http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-locking-reads.html <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/innodb-locking-reads.html>`_.

.. option:: --skip-foreign-key-checks

 Disables foreign key checks with SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0.

.. option:: --sleep

 type: int

 Sleep time between fetches.

 Specifies how long to sleep between SELECT statements.  Default is not to
 sleep at all.  Transactions are NOT committed, and the :option:`--file` file is NOT
 flushed, before sleeping.  See :option:`--txn-size` to control that.

 If :option:`--commit-each` is specified, committing and flushing happens before
 sleeping.

.. option:: --sleep-coef

 type: float

 Calculate :option:`--sleep` as a multiple of the last SELECT time.

 If this option is specified, :program:`mariadb-archiver` will sleep for the query time of the
 last SELECT multiplied by the specified coefficient.

 This is a slightly more sophisticated way to throttle the SELECTs: sleep a
 varying amount of time between each SELECT, depending on how long the SELECTs
 are taking.

.. option:: --socket

 short form: -S; type: string

 Socket file to use for connection.

.. option:: --source

 type: DSN

 DSN specifying the table to archive from (required).  This argument is a DSN.
 See DSN OPTIONS for the syntax.  Most options control how :program:`mariadb-archiver`
 connects to MariaDB, but there are some extended DSN options in this tool's
 syntax.  The D, t, and i options select a table to archive:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --source h=my_server,D=my_database,t=my_tbl

 The a option specifies the database to set as the connection's default with USE.
 If the b option is true, it disables binary logging with SQL_LOG_BIN.  The m
 option specifies pluggable actions, which an external Perl module can provide.
 The only required part is the table; other parts may be read from various
 places in the environment (such as options files).

 The 'i' part deserves special mention.  This tells :program:`mariadb-archiver` which index
 it should scan to archive.  This appears in a FORCE INDEX or USE INDEX hint in
 the SELECT statements used to fetch archivable rows.  If you don't specify
 anything, :program:`mariadb-archiver` will auto-discover a good index, preferring a ``PRIMARY
 KEY`` if one exists.  In my experience this usually works well, so most of the
 time you can probably just omit the 'i' part.

 The index is used to optimize repeated accesses to the table; :program:`mariadb-archiver`
 remembers the last row it retrieves from each SELECT statement, and uses it to
 construct a WHERE clause, using the columns in the specified index, that should
 allow MariaDB to start the next SELECT where the last one ended, rather than
 potentially scanning from the beginning of the table with each successive
 SELECT.  If you are using external plugins, please see "EXTENDING" for a
 discussion of how they interact with ascending indexes.

 The 'a' and 'b' options allow you to control how statements flow through the
 binary log.  If you specify the 'b' option, binary logging will be disabled on
 the specified connection.  If you specify the 'a' option, the connection will
 ``USE`` the specified database, which you can use to prevent slaves from
 executing the binary log events with ``--replicate-ignore-db`` options.  These
 two options can be used as different methods to achieve the same goal: archive
 data off the master, but leave it on the slave.  For example, you can run a
 purge job on the master and prevent it from happening on the slave using your
 method of choice.

 **WARNING**: Using a default options file (F) DSN option that defines a
 socket for :option:`--source` causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to connect to :option:`--dest` using
 that socket unless another socket for :option:`--dest` is specified.  This
 means that :program:`mariadb-archiver` may incorrectly connect to :option:`--source` when it
 is meant to connect to :option:`--dest`.  For example:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --source F=host1.cnf,D=db,t=tbl --dest h=host2

 When :program:`mariadb-archiver` connects to :option:`--dest`, host2, it will connect via the
 :option:`--source`, host1, socket defined in host1.cnf.

.. option:: --statistics

 Collect and print timing statistics.

 Causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to collect timing statistics about what it does.  These
 statistics are available to the plugin specified by :option:`--plugin`

 Unless you specify :option:`--quiet`, :program:`mariadb-archiver` prints the statistics when it
 exits.  The statistics look like this:

 .. code-block:: bash

   Started at 2008-07-18T07:18:53, ended at 2008-07-18T07:18:53
   Source: D=db,t=table
   SELECT 4
   INSERT 4
   DELETE 4
   Action         Count       Time        Pct
   commit            10     0.1079      88.27
   select             5     0.0047       3.87
   deleting           4     0.0028       2.29
   inserting          4     0.0028       2.28
   other              0     0.0040       3.29

 The first two (or three) lines show times and the source and destination tables.
 The next three lines show how many rows were fetched, inserted, and deleted.

 The remaining lines show counts and timing.  The columns are the action, the
 total number of times that action was timed, the total time it took, and the
 percent of the program's total runtime.  The rows are sorted in order of
 descending total time.  The last row is the rest of the time not explicitly
 attributed to anything.  Actions will vary depending on command-line options.

 If :option:`--why-quit` is given, its behavior is changed slightly.  This option
 causes it to print the reason for exiting even when it's just because there are
 no more rows.

 This option requires the standard Time::HiRes module, which is part of core Perl
 on reasonably new Perl releases.

.. option:: --stop

 Stop running instances by creating the sentinel file.

 Causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to create the sentinel file specified by :option:`--sentinel` and
 exit.  This should have the effect of stopping all running instances which are
 watching the same sentinel file.

.. option:: --txn-size

 type: int; default: 1

 Number of rows per transaction.

 Specifies the size, in number of rows, of each transaction. Zero disables
 transactions altogether.  After :program:`mariadb-archiver` processes this many rows, it
 commits both the :option:`--source` and the :option:`--dest` if given, and flushes the
 file given by :option:`--file`.

 This parameter is critical to performance.  If you are archiving from a live
 server, which for example is doing heavy OLTP work, you need to choose a good
 balance between transaction size and commit overhead.  Larger transactions
 create the possibility of more lock contention and deadlocks, but smaller
 transactions cause more frequent commit overhead, which can be significant.  To
 give an idea, on a small test set I worked with while writing :program:`mariadb-archiver`, a
 value of 500 caused archiving to take about 2 seconds per 1000 rows on an
 otherwise quiet MariaDB instance on my desktop machine, archiving to disk and to
 another table.  Disabling transactions with a value of zero, which turns on
 autocommit, dropped performance to 38 seconds per thousand rows.

 If you are not archiving from or to a transactional storage engine, you may
 want to disable transactions so :program:`mariadb-archiver` doesn't try to commit.

.. option:: --user

 short form: -u; type: string

 User for login if not current user.

.. option:: --version

 Show version and exit.

.. option:: --where

 type: string

 WHERE clause to limit which rows to archive (required).

 Specifies a WHERE clause to limit which rows are archived.  Do not include the
 word WHERE.  You may need to quote the argument to prevent your shell from
 interpreting it.  For example:

 .. code-block:: bash

     --where 'ts < current_date - interval 90 day'

 For safety, :option:`--where` is required.  If you do not require a WHERE clause, use
 :option:`--where` 1=1.

.. option:: --why-quit

 Print reason for exiting unless rows exhausted.

 Causes :program:`mariadb-archiver` to print a message if it exits for any reason other than
 running out of rows to archive.  This can be useful if you have a cron job with
 :option:`--run-time` specified, for example, and you want to be sure :program:`mariadb-archiver` is
 finishing before running out of time.

 If :option:`--statistics` is given, the behavior is changed slightly.  It will print
 the reason for exiting even when it's just because there are no more rows.

 This output prints even if :option:`--quiet` is given.  That's so you can put
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` in a ``cron`` job and get an email if there's an abnormal exit.

DSN OPTIONS
===========

These DSN options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like
``option=value``.  The options are case-sensitive, so P and p are not the
same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after the ``=`` and
if the value contains whitespace it must be quoted.  DSN options are
comma-separated.  See the mariadb-tools manpage for full details.

* a

 copy: no

 Database to USE when executing queries.

* A

 dsn: charset; copy: yes

 Default character set.

* b

 copy: no

 If true, disable binlog with SQL_LOG_BIN.

* D

 dsn: database; copy: yes

 Database that contains the table.

* F

 dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

 Only read default options from the given file

* h

 dsn: host; copy: yes

 Connect to host.

* i

 copy: yes

 Index to use.

* L

 copy: yes

 Explicitly enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.

 For some reason, some vendors compile libmysql without the
 --enable-local-infile option, which disables the statement.  This can
 lead to weird situations, like the server allowing LOCAL INFILE, but 
 the client throwing exceptions if it's used.

 However, as long as the server allows LOAD DATA, clients can easily
 re-enable it; See `https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/load-data-infile/ <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/load-data-infile/>`_
 and `http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm <http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm>`_.
 This option does exactly that.

 Although we've not found a case where turning this option leads to errors or
 differing behavior, to be on the safe side, this option is not
 on by default.

* m

 copy: no

 Plugin module name.

* p

 dsn: password; copy: yes

 Password to use when connecting.
 If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash: "exam\,ple"

* P

 dsn: port; copy: yes

 Port number to use for connection.

* S

 dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

 Socket file to use for connection.

* t

 copy: yes

 Table to archive from/to.

* u

 dsn: user; copy: yes

 User for login if not current user.

EXTENDING
=========

:program:`mariadb-archiver` is extensible by plugging in external Perl modules to handle some
logic and/or actions.  You can specify a module for both the :option:`--source` and
the :option:`--dest`, with the 'm' part of the specification.  For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    --source D=test,t=test1,m=My::Module1 --dest m=My::Module2,t=test2

This will cause :program:`mariadb-archiver` to load the My::Module1 and My::Module2 packages,
create instances of them, and then make calls to them during the archiving
process.

You can also specify a plugin with :option:`--plugin`.

The module must provide this interface:

new(dbh => $dbh, db => $db_name, tbl => $tbl_name)

 The plugin's constructor is passed a reference to the database handle, the
 database name, and table name.  The plugin is created just after :program:`mariadb-archiver`
 opens the connection, and before it examines the table given in the arguments.
 This gives the plugin a chance to create and populate temporary tables, or do
 other setup work.

before_begin(cols => \@cols, allcols => \@allcols)

 This method is called just before :program:`mariadb-archiver` begins iterating through rows
 and archiving them, but after it does all other setup work (examining table
 structures, designing SQL queries, and so on).  This is the only time
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` tells the plugin column names for the rows it will pass the
 plugin while archiving.

 The ``cols`` argument is the column names the user requested to be archived,
 either by default or by the :option:`--columns` option.  The ``allcols`` argument is
 the list of column names for every row :program:`mariadb-archiver` will fetch from the source
 table.  It may fetch more columns than the user requested, because it needs some
 columns for its own use.  When subsequent plugin functions receive a row, it is
 the full row containing all the extra columns, if any, added to the end.

is_archivable(row => \@row)

 This method is called for each row to determine whether it is archivable.  This
 applies only to :option:`--source`.  The argument is the row itself, as an arrayref.
 If the method returns true, the row will be archived; otherwise it will be
 skipped.

 Skipping a row adds complications for non-unique indexes.  Normally
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` uses a WHERE clause designed to target the last processed row as
 the place to start the scan for the next SELECT statement.  If you have skipped
 the row by returning false from is_archivable(), :program:`mariadb-archiver` could get into
 an infinite loop because the row still exists.  Therefore, when you specify a
 plugin for the :option:`--source` argument, :program:`mariadb-archiver` will change its WHERE clause
 slightly.  Instead of starting at "greater than or equal to" the last processed
 row, it will start "strictly greater than."  This will work fine on unique
 indexes such as primary keys, but it may skip rows (leave holes) on non-unique
 indexes or when ascending only the first column of an index.

 :program:`mariadb-archiver` will change the clause in the same way if you specify
 :option:`--no-delete`, because again an infinite loop is possible.

 If you specify the :option:`--bulk-delete` option and return false from this method,
 :program:`mariadb-archiver` may not do what you want.  The row won't be archived, but it will
 be deleted, since bulk deletes operate on ranges of rows and don't know which
 rows the plugin selected to keep.

 If you specify the :option:`--bulk-insert` option, this method's return value will
 influence whether the row is written to the temporary file for the bulk insert,
 so bulk inserts will work as expected.  However, bulk inserts require bulk
 deletes.

before_delete(row => \@row)

 This method is called for each row just before it is deleted.  This applies only
 to :option:`--source`.  This is a good place for you to handle dependencies, such as
 deleting things that are foreign-keyed to the row you are about to delete.  You
 could also use this to recursively archive all dependent tables.

 This plugin method is called even if :option:`--no-delete` is given, but not if
 :option:`--bulk-delete` is given.

before_bulk_delete(first_row => \@row, last_row => \@row)

 This method is called just before a bulk delete is executed.  It is similar to
 the ``before_delete`` method, except its arguments are the first and last row of
 the range to be deleted.  It is called even if :option:`--no-delete` is given.

before_insert(row => \@row)

 This method is called for each row just before it is inserted.  This applies
 only to :option:`--dest`.  You could use this to insert the row into multiple tables,
 perhaps with an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause to build summary tables in a data
 warehouse.

 This method is not called if :option:`--bulk-insert` is given.

before_bulk_insert(first_row => \@row, last_row => \@row, filename => bulk_insert_filename)

 This method is called just before a bulk insert is executed.  It is similar to
 the ``before_insert`` method, except its arguments are the first and last row of
 the range to be deleted.

custom_sth(row => \@row, sql => $sql)

 This method is called just before inserting the row, but after
 "before_insert()".  It allows the plugin to specify different ``INSERT``
 statement if desired.  The return value (if any) should be a DBI statement
 handle.  The ``sql`` parameter is the SQL text used to prepare the default
 ``INSERT`` statement.  This method is not called if you specify
 :option:`--bulk-insert`.

 If no value is returned, the default ``INSERT`` statement handle is used.

 This method applies only to the plugin specified for :option:`--dest`, so if your
 plugin isn't doing what you expect, check that you've specified it for the
 destination and not the source.

custom_sth_bulk(first_row => \@row, last_row => \@row, sql => $sql, filename => $bulk_insert_filename)

 If you've specified :option:`--bulk-insert`, this method is called just before the
 bulk insert, but after "before_bulk_insert()", and the arguments are
 different.

 This method's return value etc is similar to the "custom_sth()" method.

after_finish()

 This method is called after :program:`mariadb-archiver` exits the archiving loop, commits all
 database handles, closes :option:`--file`, and prints the final statistics, but
 before :program:`mariadb-archiver` runs ANALYZE or OPTIMIZE (see :option:`--analyze` and
 :option:`--optimize`).

If you specify a plugin for both :option:`--source` and :option:`--dest`, :program:`mariadb-archiver`
constructs, calls before_begin(), and calls after_finish() on the two plugins in
the order :option:`--source`, :option:`--dest`.

:program:`mariadb-archiver` assumes it controls transactions, and that the plugin will NOT
commit or roll back the database handle.  The database handle passed to the
plugin's constructor is the same handle :program:`mariadb-archiver` uses itself.  Remember
that :option:`--source` and :option:`--dest` are separate handles.

A sample module might look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    package My::Module;

    sub new {
       my ( $class, %args ) = @_;
       return bless(\%args, $class);
    }

    sub before_begin {
       my ( $self, %args ) = @_;
       # Save column names for later
       $self->{cols} = $args{cols};
    }

    sub is_archivable {
       my ( $self, %args ) = @_;
       # Do some advanced logic with $args{row}
       return 1;
    }

    sub before_delete {} # Take no action
    sub before_insert {} # Take no action
    sub custom_sth    {} # Take no action
    sub after_finish  {} # Take no action

    1;

ENVIRONMENT
===========

The environment variable ``PTDEBUG`` enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.
To enable debugging and capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

.. code-block:: bash

    PTDEBUG=1 mariadb-archiver ... > FILE 2>&1

Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes
of output.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be
installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.
