<h2>DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <strong class="program">mariadb-iostat</strong> tool is similar to iostat, but has some advantages. It prints
read and write statistics separately, and has more columns. It is menu-driven
and interactive, with several different ways to aggregate the data. It
integrates well with the mariadb-stat tool. It also does the &#8220;right thing&#8221; by
default, such as hiding disks that are idle.  These properties make it very
convenient for quickly drilling down into I/O performance and inspecting disk
behavior.</p>
<p>This program works in two modes. The default is to collect samples of
<em>/proc/diskstats</em> and print out the formatted statistics at intervals. The other
mode is to process a file that contains saved samples of <em>/proc/diskstats</em>; there
is a shell script later in this documentation that shows how to collect such a
file.</p>
<p>In both cases, the tool is interactively controlled by keystrokes, so you can
redisplay and slice the data flexibly and easily.  It loops forever, until you
exit with the &#8216;q&#8217; key.  If you press the &#8216;?&#8217; key, you will bring up the
interactive help menu that shows which keys control the program.</p>
<p>When the program is gathering samples of <em>/proc/diskstats</em> and refreshing its
display, it prints information about the newest sample each time it refreshes.
When it is operating on a file of saved samples, it redraws the entire file&#8217;s
contents every time you change an option.</p>
<p>The program doesn&#8217;t print information about every block device on the system. It
hides devices that it has never observed to have any activity.  You can enable
and disable this by pressing the &#8216;i&#8217; key.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>OUTPUT<a class="headerlink" href="#output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the rest of this documentation, we will try to clarify the distinction
between block devices (/dev/sda1, for example), which the kernel presents to the
application via a filesystem, versus the (usually) physical device underneath
the block device, which could be a disk, a RAID controller, and so on.  We will
sometimes refer to logical I/O operations, which occur at the block device,
versus physical I/Os which are performed on the underlying device.  When we
refer to the queue, we are speaking of the queue associated with the block
device, which holds requests until they&#8217;re issued to the physical device.</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s output looks like the following sample, which is too wide for this
manual page, so we have formatted it as several samples with line breaks:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The columns are as follows:</p>
<p>#ts</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This column&#8217;s contents vary depending on the tool&#8217;s aggregation mode.  In the
default mode, when each line contains information about a single disk but
possibly aggregates across several samples from that disk, this column shows the
number of samples that were included into the line of output, in {curly braces}.
In the example shown, each line of output aggregates {10} samples of
<em>/proc/diskstats</em>.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;all&#8221; group-by mode, this column shows timestamp offsets, relative to the
time the tool began aggregating or the timestamp of the previous lines printed,
depending on the mode.  The output can be confusing to explain, but it&#8217;s rather
intuitive when you see the lines appearing on your screen periodically.</p>
<p>Similarly, in &#8220;sample&#8221; group-by mode, the number indicates the total time span
that is grouped into each sample.</p>
<p>If you specify <a class="reference internal" href="#cmdoption-mariadb-iostat--show-timestamps"><em class="xref std std-option">--show-timestamps</em></a>, this field instead shows the timestamp at
which the sample was taken; if multiple timestamps are present in a single line
of output, then the first timestamp is used.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>device</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The device name.  If there is more than one device, then instead the number
of devices aggregated into the line is shown, in {curly braces}.</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_s</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average number of reads per second.  This is the number of I/O requests that
were sent to the underlying device.  This usually is a smaller number than the
number of logical IO requests made by applications.  More requests might have
been queued to the block device, but some of them usually are merged before
being sent to the disk.</p>
<p>This field is computed from the contents of <em>/proc/diskstats</em> as follows.  See
&#8220;KERNEL DOCUMENTATION&#8221; below for the meaning of the field numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>delta<span class="o">[</span>field1<span class="o">]</span> / delta<span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_avkb</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average size of the reads, in kilobytes.  This field is computed as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>2 * delta<span class="o">[</span>field3<span class="o">]</span> / delta<span class="o">[</span>field1<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_mb_s</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average number of megabytes read per second.  Computed as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>2 * delta<span class="o">[</span>field3<span class="o">]</span> / delta<span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_mrg</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The percentage of read requests that were merged together in the queue scheduler
before being sent to the physical device.  The field is computed as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>100 * delta<span class="o">[</span>field2<span class="o">]</span> / <span class="o">(</span>delta<span class="o">[</span>field2<span class="o">]</span> + delta<span class="o">[</span>field1<span class="o">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_cnc</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average concurrency of the read operations, as computed by Little&#8217;s Law.
This is the end-to-end concurrency on the block device, not the underlying
disk&#8217;s concurrency. It includes time spent in the queue.  The field is computed
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>delta<span class="o">[</span>field4<span class="o">]</span> / delta<span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="o">]</span> / 1000 / devices-in-group
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rd_rt</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average response time of the read operations, in milliseconds.  This is the
end-to-end response time, including time spent in the queue.  It is the response
time that the application making I/O requests sees, not the response time of the
physical disk underlying the block device.  It is computed as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>delta<span class="o">[</span>field4<span class="o">]</span> / <span class="o">(</span>delta<span class="o">[</span>field1<span class="o">]</span> + delta<span class="o">[</span>field2<span class="o">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>wr_s, wr_avkb, wr_mb_s, wr_mrg, wr_cnc, wr_rt</p>
<blockquote>
<div>These columns show write activity, and they match the corresponding columns for
read activity.</div></blockquote>
<p>busy</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The fraction of wall-clock time that the device had at least one request in
progress; this is what iostat calls %util, and indeed it is utilization,
depending on how you define utilization, but that is sometimes ambiguous in
common parlance.  It may also be called the residence time; the time during
which at least one request was resident in the system.  It is computed as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>100 * delta<span class="o">[</span>field10<span class="o">]</span> / <span class="o">(</span>1000 * delta<span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">time</span><span class="o">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This field cannot exceed 100% unless there is a rounding error, but it is a
common mistake to think that a device that&#8217;s busy all the time is saturated.  A
device such as a RAID volume should support concurrency higher than 1, and
solid-state drives can support very high concurrency.  Concurrency can grow
without bound, and is a more reliable indicator of how loaded the device really
is.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>in_prg</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The number of requests that were in progress.  Unlike the read and write
concurrencies, which are averages that are generated from reliable numbers, this
number is an instantaneous sample, and you can see that it might represent a
spike of requests, rather than the true long-term average.  If this number is
large, it essentially means that the device is heavily loaded.  It is computed
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>field9
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>ios_s</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The average throughput of the physical device, in I/O operations per second
(IOPS).  This column shows the total IOPS the underlying device is handling.  It
is the sum of rd_s and wr_s.</div></blockquote>
<p>qtime</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average queue time; that is, time a request spends in the device scheduler
queue before being sent to the physical device.  This is an average over reads
and writes.</p>
<p>It is computed in a slightly complex way: the average response time seen by the
application, minus the average service time (see the description of the next
column).  This is derived from the queueing theory formula for response time, R
= W + S: response time = queue time + service time.  This is solved for W, of
course, to give W = R - S.  The computation follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>delta<span class="o">[</span>field11<span class="o">]</span> / <span class="o">(</span>delta<span class="o">[</span>field1, 2, 5, 6<span class="o">]</span> + delta<span class="o">[</span>field9<span class="o">])</span>
   - delta<span class="o">[</span>field10<span class="o">]</span> / delta<span class="o">[</span>field1, 2, 5, 6<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>See the description for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stime</span></tt> for more details and cautions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>stime</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The average service time; that is, the time elapsed while the physical device
processes the request, after the request finishes waiting in the queue.  This is
an average over reads and writes.  It is computed from the queueing theory
utilization formula, U = SX, solved for S.  This means that utilization divided
by throughput gives service time:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>delta<span class="o">[</span>field10<span class="o">]</span> / <span class="o">(</span>delta<span class="o">[</span>field1, 2, 5, 6<span class="o">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note, however, that there can be some kernel bugs that cause field 9 in
<em>/proc/diskstats</em> to become negative, and this can cause field 10 to be wrong,
thus making the service time computation not wholly trustworthy.</p>
<p>Note that in the above formula we use utilization very specifically. It is a
duration, not a percentage.</p>
<p>You can compare the stime and qtime columns to see whether the response time for
reads and writes is spent in the queue or on the physical device.  However, you
cannot see the difference between reads and writes.  Changing the block device
scheduler algorithm might improve queue time greatly.  The default algorithm,
cfq, is very bad for servers, and should only be used on laptops and
workstations that perform tasks such as working with spreadsheets and surfing
the Internet.</p>

<h2>KERNEL DOCUMENTATION<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This documentation supplements <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt">the official
documentation</a> on the
contents of <em>/proc/diskstats</em>.  That documentation can sometimes be difficult
to understand for those who are not familiar with Linux kernel internals.  The
contents of <em>/proc/diskstats</em> are generated by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diskstats_show()</span></tt> function
in the kernel source file <em>block/genhd.c</em>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of <em>/proc/diskstats</em> on a recent kernel.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>8 1 sda1 426 243 3386 2056 3 0 18 87 0 2135 2142
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The fields in this sample are as follows.  The first three fields are the major
and minor device numbers (8, 1), and the device name (sda1). They are followed
by 11 fields of statistics:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The number of reads completed.  This is the number of physical reads done by the
underlying disk, not the number of reads that applications made from the block
device.  This means that 426 actual reads have completed successfully to the
disk on which <em>/dev/sda1</em> resides.  Reads are not counted until they complete.</li>
<li>The number of reads merged because they were adjacent.  In the sample, 243 reads
were merged. This means that <em>/dev/sda1</em> actually received 869 logical reads,
but sent only 426 physical reads to the underlying physical device.</li>
<li>The number of sectors read successfully.  The 426 physical reads to the disk
read 3386 sectors.  Sectors are 512 bytes, so a total of about 1.65MB have been
read from <em>/dev/sda1</em>.</li>
<li>The number of milliseconds spent reading.  This counts only reads that have
completed, not reads that are in progress.  It counts the time spent from when
requests are placed on the queue until they complete, not the time that the
underlying disk spends servicing the requests. That is, it measures the total
response time seen by applications, not disk response times.</li>
<li>Ditto for field 1, but for writes.</li>
<li>Ditto for field 2, but for writes.</li>
<li>Ditto for field 3, but for writes.</li>
<li>Ditto for field 4, but for writes.</li>
<li>The number of I/Os currently in progress, that is, they&#8217;ve been scheduled by the
queue scheduler and issued to the disk (submitted to the underlying disk&#8217;s
queue), but not yet completed.  There are bugs in some kernels that cause this
number, and thus fields 10 and 11, to be wrong sometimes.</li>
<li>The total number of milliseconds spent doing I/Os.  This is <strong>not</strong> the total
response time seen by the applications; it is the total amount of time during
which at least one I/O was in progress.  If one I/O is issued at time 100,
another comes in at 101, and both of them complete at 102, then this field
increments by 2, not 3.</li>
<li>This field counts the total response time of all I/Os.  In contrast to field 10,
it counts double when two I/Os overlap.  In our previous example, this field
would increment by 3, not 2.</li>

<p>When in interactive mode, wait N seconds before printing to the screen.
Also, how often the tool should sample <em>/proc/diskstats</em>.</p>
<p>The tool attempts to gather statistics exactly on even intervals of clock time.
That is, if you specify a 5-second interval, it will try to capture samples at
12:00:00, 12:00:05, and so on; it will not gather at 12:00:01, 12:00:06 and so
forth.</p>
<p>This can lead to slightly odd delays in some circumstances, because the tool
waits one full cycle before printing out the first set of lines. (Unlike iostat
and vmstat, <strong class="program">mariadb-iostat</strong> does not start with a line representing the averages
since the computer was booted.)  Therefore, the rule has an exception to avoid
very long delays.  Suppose you specify a 10-second interval, but you start the
tool at 12:00:00.01.  The tool might wait until 12:00:20 to print its first
lines of output, and in the intervening 19.99 seconds, it would appear to do
nothing.</p>
<p>To alleviate this, the tool waits until the next even interval of time to
gather, unless more than 20% of that interval remains.  This means the tool will
never wait more than 120% of the sampling interval to produce output, e.g if you
start the tool at 12:00:53 with a 10-second sampling interval, then the first
sample will be only 7 seconds long, not 10 seconds.</p>
