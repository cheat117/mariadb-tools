NAME
====

:program:`mariadb-query-digest` - Analyze MariaDB queries from logs, processlist, and tcpdump.

SYNOPSIS
========

Usage
-----

::

  mariadb-query-digest [OPTIONS] [FILES] [DSN]

:program:`mariadb-query-digest` analyzes MariaDB queries from slow, general, and binary log
files.  It can also analyze queries from ``SHOW PROCESSLIST`` and MariaDB
protocol data from tcpdump.  By default, queries are grouped by fingerprint
and reported in descending order of query time (i.e. the slowest queries
first).  If no ``FILES`` are given, the tool reads ``STDIN``.  The optional
``DSN`` is used for certain options like :option:`--since` and :option:`--until`.

Report the slowest queries from ``slow.log``:

.. code-block:: bash

    mariadb-query-digest slow.log

Report the slowest queries from the processlist on host1:

.. code-block:: bash

    mariadb-query-digest --processlist h=host1

Capture MariaDB protocol data with tcppdump, then report the slowest queries:

.. code-block:: bash

    tcpdump -s 65535 -x -nn -q -tttt -i any -c 1000 port 3306 > mariadb.tcp.txt

    mariadb-query-digest --type tcpdump mariadb.tcp.txt

Save query data from ``slow.log`` to host2 for later review and trend analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

    mariadb-query-digest --review h=host2 --no-report slow.log

RISKS
=====

MariaDB Tools is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Review the tool's known "BUGS"

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-query-digest` is a sophisticated but easy to use tool for analyzing
MariaDB queries.  It can analyze queries from MariaDB slow, general, and binary
logs. (Binary logs must first be converted to text, see :option:`--type`).
It can also use ``SHOW PROCESSLIST`` and MariaDB protocol data from tcpdump.
By default, the tool reports which queries are the slowest, and therefore
the most important to optimize.  More complex and custom-tailored reports
can be created by using options like :option:`--group-by`, :option:`--filter`, and
:option:`--embedded-attributes`.

Query analysis is a best-practice that should be done frequently.  To
make this easier, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` has two features: query review
(:option:`--review`) and query history (:option:`--history`).  When the :option:`--review`
option is used, all unique queries are saved to a database.  When the
tool is ran again with :option:`--review`, queries marked as reviewed in
the database are not printed in the report.  This highlights new queries
that need to be reviewed.  When the :option:`--history` option is used,
query metrics (query time, lock time, etc.) for each unique query are
saved to database.  Each time the tool is ran with :option:`--history`, the
more historical data is saved which can be used to trend and analyze
query performance over time.

ATTRIBUTES
==========

:program:`mariadb-query-digest` works on events, which are a collection of key-value pairs
called attributes.  You'll recognize most of the attributes right away:
``Query_time``, ``Lock_time``, and so on.  You can just look at a slow log
and see them.  However, there are some that don't exist in the slow log,
and slow logs may actually include different kinds of attributes depending
upon the MariaDB Server version.

See "ATTRIBUTES REFERENCE" near the end of this documentation for a list
of common and :option:`--type` specific attributes.  A familiarity with these
attributes is necessary for working with :option:`--filter`,
:option:`--ignore-attributes`, and other attribute-related options.

With creative use of :option:`--filter`, you can create new attributes derived
from existing attributes.  For example, to create an attribute called
``Row_ratio`` for examining the ratio of ``Rows_sent`` to ``Rows_examined``,
specify a filter like:

.. code-block:: bash

   --filter '($event->{Row_ratio} = $event->{Rows_sent} / ($event->{Rows_examined})) && 1'

The ``&& 1`` trick is needed to create a valid one-line syntax that is always
true, even if the assignment happens to evaluate false.  The new attribute will
automatically appears in the output:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Row ratio        1.00    0.00      1    0.50      1    0.71    0.50

Attributes created this way can be specified for :option:`--order-by` or any
option that requires an attribute.

OUTPUT
======

The default :option:`--output` is a query analysis report.  The :option:`--[no]report`
option controls whether or not this report is printed.  Sometimes you may
want to parse all the queries but suppress the report, for example when using
:option:`--review` or :option:`--history`.

There is one paragraph for each class of query analyzed.  A "class" of queries
all have the same value for the :option:`--group-by` attribute which is
``fingerprint`` by default.  (See "ATTRIBUTES".)  A fingerprint is an
abstracted version of the query text with literals removed, whitespace
collapsed, and so forth.  The report is formatted so it's easy to paste into
emails without wrapping, and all non-query lines begin with a comment, so you
can save it to a .sql file and open it in your favorite syntax-highlighting
text editor.  There is a response-time profile at the beginning.

The output described here is controlled by :option:`--report-format`.
That option allows you to specify what to print and in what order.
The default output in the default order is described here.

The report, by default, begins with a paragraph about the entire analysis run
The information is very similar to what you'll see for each class of queries in
the log, but it doesn't have some information that would be too expensive to
keep globally for the analysis.  It also has some statistics about the code's
execution itself, such as the CPU and memory usage, the local date and time
of the run, and a list of input file read/parsed.

Following this is the response-time profile over the events.  This is a
highly summarized view of the unique events in the detailed query report
that follows.  It contains the following columns:

.. code-block:: bash

  Column        Meaning
  ============  ==========================================================
  Rank          The query's rank within the entire set of queries analyzed
  Query ID      The query's fingerprint
  Response time The total response time, and percentage of overall total
  Calls         The number of times this query was executed
  R/Call        The mean response time per execution
  V/M           The Variance-to-mean ratio of response time
  Item          The distilled query

A final line whose rank is shown as MISC contains aggregate statistics on the
queries that were not included in the report, due to options such as
:option:`--limit` and :option:`--outliers`.  For details on the variance-to-mean ratio,
please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_dispersion.

Next, the detailed query report is printed.  Each query appears in a paragraph.
Here is a sample, slightly reformatted so 'perldoc' will not wrap lines in a
terminal.  The following will all be one paragraph, but we'll break it up for
commentary.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Query 2: 0.01 QPS, 0.02x conc, ID 0xFDEA8D2993C9CAF3 at byte 160665

This line identifies the sequential number of the query in the sort order
specified by :option:`--order-by`.  Then there's the queries per second, and the
approximate concurrency for this query (calculated as a function of the timespan
and total Query_time).  Next there's a query ID.  This ID is a hex version of
the query's checksum in the database, if you're using :option:`--review`.  You can
select the reviewed query's details from the database with a query like ``SELECT
.... WHERE checksum=0xFDEA8D2993C9CAF3``.

If you are investigating the report and want to print out every sample of a
particular query, then the following :option:`--filter` may be helpful:

.. code-block:: bash

    mariadb-query-digest slow.log           \
       --no-report                     \
       --output slowlog                \
       --filter '$event->{fingerprint} \
            && make_checksum($event->{fingerprint}) eq "FDEA8D2993C9CAF3"'

Notice that you must remove the ``0x`` prefix from the checksum.

Finally, in case you want to find a sample of the query in the log file, there's
the byte offset where you can look.  (This is not always accurate, due to some
anomalies in the slow log format, but it's usually right.)  The position
refers to the worst sample, which we'll see more about below.

Next is the table of metrics about this class of queries.

.. code-block:: bash

  #           pct   total    min    max     avg     95%  stddev  median
  # Count       0       2
  # Exec time  13   1105s   552s   554s    553s    554s      2s    553s
  # Lock time   0   216us   99us  117us   108us   117us    12us   108us
  # Rows sent  20   6.26M  3.13M  3.13M   3.13M   3.13M   12.73   3.13M
  # Rows exam   0   6.26M  3.13M  3.13M   3.13M   3.13M   12.73   3.13M

The first line is column headers for the table.  The percentage is the percent
of the total for the whole analysis run, and the total is the actual value of
the specified metric.  For example, in this case we can see that the query
executed 2 times, which is 13% of the total number of queries in the file.  The
min, max and avg columns are self-explanatory.  The 95% column shows the 95th
percentile; 95% of the values are less than or equal to this value.  The
standard deviation shows you how tightly grouped the values are.  The standard
deviation and median are both calculated from the 95th percentile, discarding
the extremely large values.

The stddev, median and 95th percentile statistics are approximate.  Exact
statistics require keeping every value seen, sorting, and doing some
calculations on them.  This uses a lot of memory.  To avoid this, we keep 1000
buckets, each of them 5% bigger than the one before, ranging from .000001 up to
a very big number.  When we see a value we increment the bucket into which it
falls.  Thus we have fixed memory per class of queries.  The drawback is the
imprecision, which typically falls in the 5 percent range.

Next we have statistics on the users, databases and time range for the query.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Users       1   user1
  # Databases   2     db1(1), db2(1)
  # Time range 2008-11-26 04:55:18 to 2008-11-27 00:15:15

The users and databases are shown as a count of distinct values, followed by the
values.  If there's only one, it's shown alone; if there are many, we show each
of the most frequent ones, followed by the number of times it appears.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Query_time distribution
  #   1us
  #  10us
  # 100us
  #   1ms
  #  10ms  #####
  # 100ms  ####################
  #    1s  ##########
  #  10s+

The execution times show a logarithmic chart of time clustering.  Each query
goes into one of the "buckets" and is counted up.  The buckets are powers of
ten.  The first bucket is all values in the "single microsecond range" -- that
is, less than 10us.  The second is "tens of microseconds," which is from 10us
up to (but not including) 100us; and so on.  The charted attribute can be
changed by specifying :option:`--report-histogram` but is limited to time-based
attributes.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Tables
  #    SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'table1'\G
  #    SHOW CREATE TABLE `table1`\G
  # EXPLAIN
  SELECT * FROM table1\G

This section is a convenience: if you're trying to optimize the queries you see
in the slow log, you probably want to examine the table structure and size.
These are copy-and-paste-ready commands to do that.

Finally, we see a sample of the queries in this class of query.  This is not a
random sample.  It is the query that performed the worst, according to the sort
order given by :option:`--order-by`.  You will normally see a commented ``# EXPLAIN``
line just before it, so you can copy-paste the query to examine its EXPLAIN
plan. But for non-SELECT queries that isn't possible to do, so the tool tries to
transform the query into a roughly equivalent SELECT query, and adds that below.

If you want to find this sample event in the log, use the offset mentioned
above, and something like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   tail -c +<offset> /path/to/file | head

See also :option:`--report-format`.

QUERY REVIEW
============

A query :option:`--review` is the process of storing all the query fingerprints 
analyzed.  This has several benefits:

*

 You can add metadata to classes of queries, such as marking them for follow-up,
 adding notes to queries, or marking them with an issue ID for your issue
 tracking system.

*

 You can refer to the stored values on subsequent runs so you'll know whether
 you've seen a query before.  This can help you cut down on duplicated work.

*

 You can store historical data such as the row count, query times, and generally
 anything you can see in the report.

To use this feature, you run :program:`mariadb-query-digest` with the :option:`--review` option.  It
will store the fingerprints and other information into the table you specify.
Next time you run it with the same option, it will do the following:

*

 It won't show you queries you've already reviewed.  A query is considered to be
 already reviewed if you've set a value for the ``reviewed_by`` column.  (If you
 want to see queries you've already reviewed, use the :option:`--report-all` option.)

*

 Queries that you've reviewed, and don't appear in the output, will cause gaps in
 the query number sequence in the first line of each paragraph.  And the value
 you've specified for :option:`--limit` will still be honored.  So if you've reviewed all
 queries in the top 10 and you ask for the top 10, you won't see anything in the
 output.

*

 If you want to see the queries you've already reviewed, you can specify
 :option:`--report-all`.  Then you'll see the normal analysis output, but you'll
 also see the information from the review table, just below the execution time
 graph.  For example,

 .. code-block:: bash

    # Review information
    #      comments: really bad IN() subquery, fix soon!
    #    first_seen: 2008-12-01 11:48:57
    #   jira_ticket: 1933
    #     last_seen: 2008-12-18 11:49:07
    #      priority: high
    #   reviewed_by: xaprb
    #   reviewed_on: 2008-12-18 15:03:11

 This metadata is useful because, as you analyze your queries, you get
 your comments integrated right into the report.

FINGERPRINTS
============

A query fingerprint is the abstracted form of a query, which makes it possible
to group similar queries together.  Abstracting a query removes literal values,
normalizes whitespace, and so on.  For example, consider these two queries:

.. code-block:: bash

   SELECT name, password FROM user WHERE id='12823';
   select name,   password from user
      where id=5;

Both of those queries will fingerprint to

.. code-block:: bash

   select name, password from user where id=?

Once the query's fingerprint is known, we can then talk about a query as though
it represents all similar queries.

What :program:`mariadb-query-digest` does is analogous to a GROUP BY statement in SQL.  (But
note that "multiple columns" doesn't define a multi-column grouping; it defines
multiple reports!) If your command-line looks like this,

.. code-block:: bash

   mariadb-query-digest               \
       --group-by fingerprint    \
       --order-by Query_time:sum \
       --limit 10                \
       slow.log

The corresponding pseudo-SQL looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   SELECT WORST(query BY Query_time), SUM(Query_time), ...
   FROM /path/to/slow.log
   GROUP BY FINGERPRINT(query)
   ORDER BY SUM(Query_time) DESC
   LIMIT 10

You can also use the value ``distill``, which is a kind of super-fingerprint.
See :option:`--group-by` for more.

Query fingerprinting accommodates many special cases, which have proven
necessary in the real world.  For example, an ``IN`` list with 5 literals
is really equivalent to one with 4 literals, so lists of literals are
collapsed to a single one.  If you find something that is not fingerprinted
properly, please submit a bug report with a reproducible test case.

Here is a list of transformations during fingerprinting, which might not
be exhaustive:

*

 Group all SELECT queries from mariadb-dump together, even if they are against
 different tables.  The same applies to all queries from pt-table-checksum.

*

 Shorten multi-value INSERT statements to a single VALUES() list.

*

 Strip comments.

*

 Abstract the databases in USE statements, so all USE statements are grouped
 together.

*

 Replace all literals, such as quoted strings.  For efficiency, the code that
 replaces literal numbers is somewhat non-selective, and might replace some
 things as numbers when they really are not.  Hexadecimal literals are also
 replaced.  NULL is treated as a literal.  Numbers embedded in identifiers are
 also replaced, so tables named similarly will be fingerprinted to the same
 values (e.g. users_2009 and users_2010 will fingerprint identically).

*

 Collapse all whitespace into a single space.

*

 Lowercase the entire query.

*

 Replace all literals inside of IN() and VALUES() lists with a single
 placeholder, regardless of cardinality.

*

 Collapse multiple identical UNION queries into a single one.

OPTIONS
=======

This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the
"SYNOPSIS" and usage information for details.

.. option:: --ask-pass

 Prompt for a password when connecting to MariaDB.

.. option:: --attribute-aliases

 type: array; default: db|Schema

 List of attribute|alias,etc.

 Certain attributes have multiple names, like db and Schema.  If an event does
 not have the primary attribute, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` looks for an alias attribute.
 If it finds an alias, it creates the primary attribute with the alias
 attribute's value and removes the alias attribute.

 If the event has the primary attribute, all alias attributes are deleted.

 This helps simplify event attributes so that, for example, there will not
 be report lines for both db and Schema.

.. option:: --attribute-value-limit

 type: int; default: 0

 A sanity limit for attribute values.

 This option deals with bugs in slow logging functionality that causes large
 values for attributes.  If the attribute's value is bigger than this, the
 last-seen value for that class of query is used instead.
 Disabled by default.

.. option:: --charset

 short form: -A; type: string

 Default character set.  If the value is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on
 STDOUT to utf8, passes the mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and
 runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MariaDB.  Any other value sets
 binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after
 connecting to MariaDB.

.. option:: --config

 type: Array

 Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the
 first option on the command line.

.. option:: --[no]continue-on-error

 default: yes

 Continue parsing even if there is an error.  The tool will not continue
 forever: it stops once any process causes 100 errors, in which case there
 is probably a bug in the tool or the input is invalid.

.. option:: --[no]create-history-table

 default: yes

 Create the :option:`--history` table if it does not exist.

 This option causes the table specified by :option:`--history` to be created
 with the default structure shown in the documentation for :option:`--history`.

.. option:: --[no]create-review-table

 default: yes

 Create the :option:`--review` table if it does not exist.

 This option causes the table specified by :option:`--review` to be created
 with the default structure shown in the documentation for :option:`--review`.

.. option:: --daemonize

 Fork to the background and detach from the shell.  POSIX
 operating systems only.

.. option:: --database

 short form: -D; type: string

 Connect to this database.

.. option:: --defaults-file

 short form: -F; type: string

 Only read mariadb options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

.. option:: --embedded-attributes

 type: array

 Two Perl regex patterns to capture pseudo-attributes embedded in queries.

 Embedded attributes might be special attribute-value pairs that you've hidden
 in comments.  The first regex should match the entire set of attributes (in
 case there are multiple).  The second regex should match and capture
 attribute-value pairs from the first regex.

 For example, suppose your query looks like the following:

 .. code-block:: bash

    SELECT * from users -- file: /login.php, line: 493;

 You might run :program:`mariadb-query-digest` with the following option:

 .. code-block:: bash

    :program:`mariadb-query-digest` --embedded-attributes ' -- .*','(\w+): ([^\,]+)'

 The first regular expression captures the whole comment:

 .. code-block:: bash

    " -- file: /login.php, line: 493;"

 The second one splits it into attribute-value pairs and adds them to the event:

 .. code-block:: bash

     ATTRIBUTE  VALUE
     =========  ==========
     file       /login.php
     line       493

 **NOTE**: All commas in the regex patterns must be escaped with otherwise
 the pattern will break.

.. option:: --expected-range

 type: array; default: 5,10

 Explain items when there are more or fewer than expected.

 Defines the number of items expected to be seen in the report given by
 :option:`--[no]report`, as controlled by :option:`--limit` and :option:`--outliers`.  If
 there  are more or fewer items in the report, each one will explain why it was
 included.

.. option:: --explain

 type: DSN

 Run EXPLAIN for the sample query with this DSN and print results.

 This works only when :option:`--group-by` includes fingerprint.  It causes
 :program:`mariadb-query-digest` to run EXPLAIN and include the output into the report.  For
 safety, queries that appear to have a subquery that EXPLAIN will execute won't
 be EXPLAINed.  Those are typically "derived table" queries of the form

 .. code-block:: bash

    select ... from ( select .... ) der;

 The EXPLAIN results are printed as a full vertical format in the event report,
 which appears at the end of each event report in vertical style
 (``\G``) just like MariaDB prints it.

.. option:: --filter

 type: string

 Discard events for which this Perl code doesn't return true.

 This option is a string of Perl code or a file containing Perl code that gets
 compiled into a subroutine with one argument: $event.  This is a hashref.
 If the given value is a readable file, then :program:`mariadb-query-digest` reads the entire
 file and uses its contents as the code.  The file should not contain
 a shebang (#!/usr/bin/perl) line.

 If the code returns true, the chain of callbacks continues; otherwise it ends.
 The code is the last statement in the subroutine other than ``return $event``. 
 The subroutine template is:

 .. code-block:: bash

    sub { $event = shift; filter && return $event; }

 Filters given on the command line are wrapped inside parentheses like like
 ``( filter )``.  For complex, multi-line filters, you must put the code inside
 a file so it will not be wrapped inside parentheses.  Either way, the filter
 must produce syntactically valid code given the template.  For example, an
 if-else branch given on the command line would not be valid:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --filter 'if () { } else { }'  # WRONG

 Since it's given on the command line, the if-else branch would be wrapped inside
 parentheses which is not syntactically valid.  So to accomplish something more
 complex like this would require putting the code in a file, for example
 filter.txt:

 .. code-block:: bash

    my $event_ok; if (...) { $event_ok=1; } else { $event_ok=0; } $event_ok

 Then specify ``--filter filter.txt`` to read the code from filter.txt.

 If the filter code won't compile, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` will die with an error.
 If the filter code does compile, an error may still occur at runtime if the
 code tries to do something wrong (like pattern match an undefined value).
 :program:`mariadb-query-digest` does not provide any safeguards so code carefully!

 An example filter that discards everything but SELECT statements:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --filter '$event->{arg} =~ m/^select/i'

 This is compiled into a subroutine like the following:

 .. code-block:: bash

    sub { $event = shift; ( $event->{arg} =~ m/^select/i ) && return $event; }

 It is permissible for the code to have side effects (to alter ``$event``).

 See "ATTRIBUTES REFERENCE" for a list of common and :option:`--type` specific
 attributes.

 Here are more examples of filter code:

 Host/IP matches domain.com

  --filter '($event->{host} || $event->{ip} || "") =~ m/domain.com/'

  Sometimes MariaDB logs the host where the IP is expected.  Therefore, we
  check both.


 User matches john

  --filter '($event->{user} || "") =~ m/john/'


 More than 1 warning

  --filter '($event->{Warning_count} || 0) > 1'


 Query does full table scan or full join

  --filter '(($event->{Full_scan} || "") eq "Yes") || (($event->{Full_join} || "") eq "Yes")'


 Query was not served from query cache

  --filter '($event->{QC_Hit} || "") eq "No"'


 Query is 1 MB or larger

  --filter '$event->{bytes} >= 1_048_576'


 Since :option:`--filter` allows you to alter ``$event``, you can use it to do other
 things, like create new attributes.  See "ATTRIBUTES" for an example.

.. option:: --group-by

 type: Array; default: fingerprint

 Which attribute of the events to group by.

 In general, you can group queries into classes based on any attribute of the
 query, such as ``user`` or ``db``, which will by default show you which users
 and which databases get the most ``Query_time``.  The default attribute,
 ``fingerprint``, groups similar, abstracted queries into classes; see below
 and see also "FINGERPRINTS".

 A report is printed for each :option:`--group-by` value (unless ``--no-report`` is
 given).  Therefore, ``--group-by user,db`` means "report on queries with the
 same user and report on queries with the same db"; it does not mean "report
 on queries with the same user and db."  See also "OUTPUT".

 Every value must have a corresponding value in the same position in
 :option:`--order-by`.  However, adding values to :option:`--group-by` will automatically
 add values to :option:`--order-by`, for your convenience.

 There are several magical values that cause some extra data mining to happen
 before the grouping takes place:

 fingerprint

  This causes events to be fingerprinted to abstract queries into
  a canonical form, which is then used to group events together into a class.
  See "FINGERPRINTS" for more about fingerprinting.


 tables

  This causes events to be inspected for what appear to be tables, and
  then aggregated by that.  Note that a query that contains two or more tables
  will be counted as many times as there are tables; so a join against two tables
  will count the Query_time against both tables.


 distill

  This is a sort of super-fingerprint that collapses queries down
  into a suggestion of what they do, such as ``INSERT SELECT table1 table2``.


.. option:: --help

 Show help and exit.

.. option:: --history

 type: DSN

 Save metrics for each query class in the given table.  :program:`mariadb-query-digest` saves
 query metrics (query time, lock time, etc.) to this table so you can see how
 query classes change over time.

 The default table is ``mariadb_tools.query_history``.  Specify database
 (D) and table (t) DSN options to override the default.  The database and
 table are automatically created unless ``--no-create-history-table``
 is specified (see :option:`--[no]create-history-table`).

 :program:`mariadb-query-digest` inspects the columns in the table.  The table must have at
 least the following columns:

 .. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE query_review_history (
      checksum     CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
      sample       LONGTEXT NOT NULL
    );

 Any columns not mentioned above are inspected to see if they follow a certain
 naming convention.  The column is special if the name ends with an underscore
 followed by any of these values:

 .. code-block:: bash

    pct|avg|cnt|sum|min|max|pct_95|stddev|median|rank

 If the column ends with one of those values, then the prefix is interpreted as
 the event attribute to store in that column, and the suffix is interpreted as
 the metric to be stored.  For example, a column named ``Query_time_min`` will be
 used to store the minimum ``Query_time`` for the class of events.

 The table should also have a primary key, but that is up to you, depending on
 how you want to store the historical data.  We suggest adding ts_min and ts_max
 columns and making them part of the primary key along with the checksum.  But
 you could also just add a ts_min column and make it a DATE type, so you'd get
 one row per class of queries per day.

 The following table definition is used for :option:`--[no]create-history-table`:

 .. code-block:: sql

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS query_history (
     checksum             CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
     sample               LONGTEXT NOT NULL,

   );

 Note that we store the count (cnt) for the ts attribute only; it will be
 redundant to store this for other attributes.

 Starting from MariaDB Toolkit 3.0.11, the checksum function has been updated to use 32 chars in the MD5 sum.
 This causes the checksum field in the history table will have a different value than in the previous versions of the tool.

.. option:: --host

 short form: -h; type: string

 Connect to host.

.. option:: --ignore-attributes

 type: array; default: arg, cmd, insert_id, ip, port, Thread_id, timestamp, exptime, flags, key, res, val, server_id, offset, end_log_pos, Xid

 Do not aggregate these attributes.  Some attributes are not query metrics
 but metadata which doesn't need to be (or can't be) aggregated.

.. option:: --inherit-attributes

 type: array; default: db,ts

 If missing, inherit these attributes from the last event that had them.

 This option sets which attributes are inherited or carried forward to events
 which do not have them.  For example, if one event has the db attribute equal
 to "foo", but the next event doesn't have the db attribute, then it inherits
 "foo" for its db attribute.

.. option:: --interval

 type: float; default: .1

 How frequently to poll the processlist, in seconds.

.. option:: --iterations

 type: int; default: 1

 How many times to iterate through the collect-and-report cycle.  If 0, iterate
 to infinity.  Each iteration runs for :option:`--run-time` amount of time.  An
 iteration is usually determined by an amount of time and a report is printed
 when that amount of time elapses.  With :option:`--run-time-mode` ``interval``,
 an interval is instead determined by the interval time you specify with
 :option:`--run-time`.  See :option:`--run-time` and :option:`--run-time-mode` for more
 information.

.. option:: --limit

 type: Array; default: 95%:20

 Limit output to the given percentage or count.

 If the argument is an integer, report only the top N worst queries.  If the
 argument is an integer followed by the ``%`` sign, report that percentage of the
 worst queries.  If the percentage is followed by a colon and another integer,
 report the top percentage or the number specified by that integer, whichever
 comes first.

 The value is actually a comma-separated array of values, one for each item in
 :option:`--group-by`.  If you don't specify a value for any of those items, the
 default is the top 95%.

 See also :option:`--outliers`.

.. option:: --log

 type: string

 Print all output to this file when daemonized.

.. option:: --max-hostname-length

 type: int; default: 10

 Trim host names in reports to this length. 0=Do not trim host names.

.. option:: --max-line-length

 type: int; default: 74

 Trim lines to this length. 0=Do not trim lines.

.. option:: --order-by

 type: Array; default: Query_time:sum

 Sort events by this attribute and aggregate function.

 This is a comma-separated list of order-by expressions, one for each
 :option:`--group-by` attribute.  The default ``Query_time:sum`` is used for
 :option:`--group-by` attributes without explicitly given :option:`--order-by` attributes
 (that is, if you specify more :option:`--group-by` attributes than corresponding
 :option:`--order-by` attributes).  The syntax is ``attribute:aggregate``.  See
 "ATTRIBUTES" for valid attributes.  Valid aggregates are:

 .. code-block:: bash

     Aggregate Meaning
     ========= ============================
     sum       Sum/total attribute value
     min       Minimum attribute value
     max       Maximum attribute value
     cnt       Frequency/count of the query

 For example, the default ``Query_time:sum`` means that queries in the
 query analysis report will be ordered (sorted) by their total query execution
 time ("Exec time").  ``Query_time:max`` orders the queries by their
 maximum query execution time, so the query with the single largest
 ``Query_time`` will be list first.  ``cnt`` refers more to the frequency
 of the query as a whole, how often it appears; "Count" is its corresponding
 line in the query analysis report.  So any attribute and ``cnt`` should yield
 the same report wherein queries are sorted by the number of times they
 appear.

 When parsing general logs (:option:`--type` ``genlog``), the default :option:`--order-by`
 becomes ``Query_time:cnt``.  General logs do not report query times so only
 the ``cnt`` aggregate makes sense because all query times are zero.

 If you specify an attribute that doesn't exist in the events, then
 :program:`mariadb-query-digest` falls back to the default ``Query_time:sum`` and prints a notice
 at the beginning of the report for each query class.  You can create attributes
 with :option:`--filter` and order by them; see "ATTRIBUTES" for an example.

.. option:: --outliers

 type: array; default: Query_time:1:10

 Report outliers by attribute:percentile:count.

 The syntax of this option is a comma-separated list of colon-delimited strings.
 The first field is the attribute by which an outlier is defined.  The second is
 a number that is compared to the attribute's 95th percentile.  The third is
 optional, and is compared to the attribute's cnt aggregate.  Queries that pass
 this specification are added to the report, regardless of any limits you
 specified in :option:`--limit`.

 For example, to report queries whose 95th percentile Query_time is at least 60
 seconds and which are seen at least 5 times, use the following argument:

 .. code-block:: bash

    --outliers Query_time:60:5

 You can specify an --outliers option for each value in :option:`--group-by`.

.. option:: --output

 type: string; default: report

 How to format and print the query analysis results.  Accepted values are:

 .. code-block:: bash

     VALUE          FORMAT
     =======        ==============================
     report         Standard query analysis report
     slowlog        MariaDB slow log
     json           JSON, on array per query class
     json-anon      JSON without example queries
     secure-slowlog JSON without example queries

 The entire ``report`` output can be disabled by specifying ``--no-report``
 (see :option:`--[no]report`), and its sections can be disabled or rearranged
 by specifying :option:`--report-format`.

 ``json`` output was introduced in 2.2.1 and is still in development,
 so the data structure may change in future versions.

.. option:: --password

 short form: -p; type: string

 Password to use when connecting.
 If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash: "exam\,ple"

.. option:: --pid

 type: string

 Create the given PID file.  The tool won't start if the PID file already
 exists and the PID it contains is different than the current PID.  However,
 if the PID file exists and the PID it contains is no longer running, the
 tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
 removed automatically when the tool exits.

.. option:: --port

 short form: -P; type: int

 Port number to use for connection.

.. option:: --preserve-embedded-numbers

 Preserve numbers in database/table names when fingerprinting queries.
 The standar fingeprint method replaces numbers in db/tables names, making
 a query like 'SELECT * FROM db1.table2' to be figerprinted as 'SELECT * FROM db?.table?'.
 This option changes that behaviour and the fingerprint will become 
 'SELECT * FROM db1.table2'.

.. option:: --processlist

 type: DSN

 Poll this DSN's processlist for queries, with :option:`--interval` sleep between.

 If the connection fails, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` tries to reopen it once per second.

.. option:: --progress

 type: array; default: time,30

 Print progress reports to STDERR.  The value is a comma-separated list with two
 parts.  The first part can be percentage, time, or iterations; the second part
 specifies how often an update should be printed, in percentage, seconds, or
 number of iterations.

.. option:: --read-timeout

 type: time; default: 0

 Wait this long for an event from the input; 0 to wait forever.

 This option sets the maximum time to wait for an event from the input.  It
 applies to all types of input except :option:`--processlist`.  If an
 event is not received after the specified time, the script stops reading the
 input and prints its reports.  If :option:`--iterations` is 0 or greater than
 1, the next iteration will begin, else the script will exit.

 This option requires the Perl POSIX module.

.. option:: --[no]report

 default: yes

 Print query analysis reports for each :option:`--group-by` attribute.  This is
 the standard slow log analysis functionality.  See "OUTPUT" for the
 description of what this does and what the results look like.

 If you don't need a report (for example, when using :option:`--review` or
 :option:`--history`), it is best to specify ``--no-report`` because this allows
 the tool to skip some expensive operations.

.. option:: --report-all

 Report all queries, even ones that have been reviewed.  This only affects
 the ``report`` :option:`--output` when using :option:`--review`.  Otherwise, all
 queries are always printed.

.. option:: --report-format

 type: Array; default: rusage,date,hostname,files,header,profile,query_report,prepared

 Print these sections of the query analysis report.

 .. code-block:: bash

    SECTION      PRINTS
    ============ ======================================================
    rusage       CPU times and memory usage reported by ps
    date         Current local date and time
    hostname     Hostname of machine on which :program:`mariadb-query-digest` was run
    files        Input files read/parse
    header       Summary of the entire analysis run
    profile      Compact table of queries for an overview of the report
    query_report Detailed information about each unique query
    prepared     Prepared statements

 The sections are printed in the order specified.  The rusage, date, files and
 header sections are grouped together if specified together; other sections are
 separated by blank lines.

 See "OUTPUT" for more information on the various parts of the query report.

.. option:: --report-histogram

 type: string; default: Query_time

 Chart the distribution of this attribute's values.

 The distribution chart is limited to time-based attributes, so charting
 ``Rows_examined``, for example, will produce a useless chart.  Charts look
 like:

 .. code-block:: bash

    # Query_time distribution
    #   1us
    #  10us
    # 100us
    #   1ms
    #  10ms  ###########################
    # 100ms  ########################################################
    #    1s  ########
    #  10s+

 See "OUTPUT" for more information.

.. option:: --resume

 type: string

 If specified, the tool writes the last file offset, if there is one,
 to the given filename. When ran again with the same value for this option,
 the tool reads the last file offset from the file, seeks to that position
 in the log, and resumes parsing events from that point onward.

.. option:: --review

 type: DSN

 Save query classes for later review, and don't report already reviewed classes.

 The default table is ``mariadb_tools.query_review``.  Specify database
 (D) and table (t) DSN options to override the default.  The database and
 table are automatically created unless ``--no-create-review-table``
 is specified (see :option:`--[no]create-review-table`).

 If the table was created manually, it must have at least the following columns.
 You can add more columns for your own special purposes, but they won't be used
 by :program:`mariadb-query-digest`.

 .. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS query_review (
       checksum     CHAR(32) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       fingerprint  TEXT NOT NULL,
       sample       TEXT NOT NULL,
       first_seen   DATETIME,
       last_seen    DATETIME,
       reviewed_by  VARCHAR(20),
       reviewed_on  DATETIME,
       comments     TEXT
    )

 The columns are:

 .. code-block:: bash

    COLUMN       MEANING
    ===========  ====================================================
    checksum     A 64-bit checksum of the query fingerprint
    fingerprint  The abstracted version of the query; its primary key
    sample       The query text of a sample of the class of queries
    first_seen   The smallest timestamp of this class of queries
    last_seen    The largest timestamp of this class of queries
    reviewed_by  Initially NULL; if set, query is skipped thereafter
    reviewed_on  Initially NULL; not assigned any special meaning
    comments     Initially NULL; not assigned any special meaning

 Note that the ``fingerprint`` column is the true primary key for a class of
 queries.  The ``checksum`` is just a cryptographic hash of this value, which
 provides a shorter value that is very likely to also be unique.

 After parsing and aggregating events, your table should contain a row for each
 fingerprint.  This option depends on ``--group-by fingerprint`` (which is the
 default).  It will not work otherwise.

.. option:: --run-time

 type: time

 How long to run for each :option:`--iterations`.  The default is to run forever
 (you can interrupt with CTRL-C).  Because :option:`--iterations` defaults to 1,
 if you only specify :option:`--run-time`, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` runs for that amount of
 time and then exits.  The two options are specified together to do
 collect-and-report cycles.  For example, specifying :option:`--iterations` ``4``
 :option:`--run-time` ``15m`` with a continuous input (like STDIN or
 :option:`--processlist`) will cause :program:`mariadb-query-digest` to run for 1 hour
 (15 minutes x 4), reporting four times, once at each 15 minute interval.

.. option:: --run-time-mode

 type: string; default: clock

 Set what the value of :option:`--run-time` operates on.  Following are the possible
 values for this option:

 clock

  :option:`--run-time` specifies an amount of real clock time during which the tool
  should run for each :option:`--iterations`.


 event

  :option:`--run-time` specifies an amount of log time.  Log time is determined by
  timestamps in the log.  The first timestamp seen is remembered, and each
  timestamp after that is compared to the first to determine how much log time
  has passed.  For example, if the first timestamp seen is ``12:00:00`` and the
  next is ``12:01:30``, that is 1 minute and 30 seconds of log time.  The tool
  will read events until the log time is greater than or equal to the specified
  :option:`--run-time` value.

  Since timestamps in logs are not always printed, or not always printed
  frequently, this mode varies in accuracy.


 interval

  :option:`--run-time` specifies interval boundaries of log time into which events
  are divided and reports are generated.  This mode is different from the
  others because it doesn't specify how long to run.  The value of
  :option:`--run-time` must be an interval that divides evenly into minutes, hours
  or days.  For example, ``5m`` divides evenly into hours (60/5=12, so 12
  5 minutes intervals per hour) but ``7m`` does not (60/7=8.6).

  Specifying ``--run-time-mode interval --run-time 30m --iterations 0`` is
  similar to specifying ``--run-time-mode clock --run-time 30m --iterations 0``.
  In the latter case, :program:`mariadb-query-digest` will run forever, producing reports every
  30 minutes, but this only works effectively with  continuous inputs like
  STDIN and the processlist.  For fixed inputs, like log files, the former
  example produces multiple reports by dividing the log into 30 minutes
  intervals based on timestamps.

  Intervals are calculated from the zeroth second/minute/hour in which a
  timestamp occurs, not from whatever time it specifies.  For example,
  with 30 minute intervals and a timestamp of ``12:10:30``, the interval
  is *not* ``12:10:30`` to ``12:40:30``, it is ``12:00:00`` to ``12:29:59``.
  Or, with 1 hour intervals, it is ``12:00:00`` to ``12:59:59``.
  When a new timestamp exceeds the interval, a report is printed, and the
  next interval is recalculated based on the new timestamp.

  Since :option:`--iterations` is 1 by default, you probably want to specify
  a new value else :program:`mariadb-query-digest` will only get and report on the first
  interval from the log since 1 interval = 1 iteration.  If you want to
  get and report every interval in a log, specify :option:`--iterations` ``0``.


.. option:: --sample

 type: int

 Filter out all but the first N occurrences of each query.  The queries are
 filtered on the first value in :option:`--group-by`, so by default, this will filter
 by query fingerprint.  For example, ``--sample 2`` will permit two sample queries
 for each fingerprint.  Useful in conjunction with ``--output slowlog`` to print
 the queries.  You probably want to set ``--no-report`` to avoid the overhead of
 aggregating and reporting if you're just using this to print out samples of
 queries.  A complete example:

 .. code-block:: bash

    :program:`mariadb-query-digest` --sample 2 --no-report --output slowlog slow.log


.. option:: --slave-user

 type: string

 Sets the user to be used to connect to the slaves.
 This parameter allows you to have a different user with less privileges on the
 slaves but that user must exist on all slaves.

.. option:: --slave-password

 type: string

 Sets the password to be used to connect to the slaves.
 It can be used with --slave-user and the password for the user must be the same
 on all slaves.

.. option:: --set-vars

 type: Array

 Set the MariaDB variables in this comma-separated list of ``variable=value`` pairs.

 By default, the tool sets:

 .. code-block:: bash

     wait_timeout=10000

 Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For
 example, specifying ``--set-vars wait_timeout=500`` overrides the defaultvalue of ``10000``.

 The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

.. option:: --show-all

 type: Hash

 Show all values for these attributes.

 By default :program:`mariadb-query-digest` only shows as many of an attribute's value that
 fit on a single line.  This option allows you to specify attributes for which
 all values will be shown (line width is ignored).  This only works for
 attributes with string values like user, host, db, etc.  Multiple attributes
 can be specified, comma-separated.

.. option:: --since

 type: string

 Parse only queries newer than this value (parse queries since this date).

 This option allows you to ignore queries older than a certain value and parse
 only those queries which are more recent than the value.  The value can be
 several types:

 .. code-block:: bash

    * Simple time value N with optional suffix: N[shmd], where
      s=seconds, h=hours, m=minutes, d=days (default s if no suffix
      given); this is like saying "since N[shmd] ago"
    * Full date with optional hours:minutes:seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS]
    * Short, MariaDB-style date:
      YYMMDD [HH:MM:SS]
    * Any time expression evaluated by MariaDB:
      CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 7 DAY

 If you give a MariaDB time expression, and you have not also specified a DSN
 for :option:`--explain`, :option:`--processlist`, or :option:`--review`, then you must specify
 a DSN on the command line so that :program:`mariadb-query-digest` can connect to MariaDB to
 evaluate the expression.

 The MariaDB time expression is wrapped inside a query like
 "SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(<expression>)", so be sure that the expression is
 valid inside this query.  For example, do not use UNIX_TIMESTAMP() because
 UNIX_TIMESTAMP(UNIX_TIMESTAMP()) returns 0.

 Events are assumed to be in chronological: older events at the beginning of
 the log and newer events at the end of the log.  :option:`--since` is strict: it
 ignores all queries until one is found that is new enough.  Therefore, if
 the query events are not consistently timestamped, some may be ignored which
 are actually new enough.

 See also :option:`--until`.

.. option:: --socket

 short form: -S; type: string

 Socket file to use for connection.

.. option:: --timeline

 Show a timeline of events.

 This option makes :program:`mariadb-query-digest` print another kind of report: a timeline of
 the events.  Each query is still grouped and aggregate into classes according to
 :option:`--group-by`, but then they are printed in chronological order.  The timeline
 report prints out the timestamp, interval, count and value of each classes.

 If all you want is the timeline report, then specify ``--no-report`` to
 suppress the default query analysis report.  Otherwise, the timeline report
 will be printed at the end before the response-time profile
 (see :option:`--report-format` and "OUTPUT").

 For example, this:

 .. code-block:: bash

    :program:`mariadb-query-digest` /path/to/log --group-by distill --timeline

 will print something like:

 .. code-block:: bash

    # ########################################################
    # distill report
    # ########################################################
    # 2009-07-25 11:19:27 1+00:00:01   2 SELECT foo
    # 2009-07-27 11:19:30      00:01   2 SELECT bar
    # 2009-07-27 11:30:00 1+06:30:00   2 SELECT foo


.. option:: --type

 type: Array; default: slowlog

 The type of input to parse.  The permitted types are

 binlog

  Parse a binary log file that has first been converted to text using mariadb-binlog.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: bash

      mariadb-binlog mariadb-bin.000441 > mariadb-bin.000441.txt

      :program:`mariadb-query-digest` --type binlog mariadb-bin.000441.txt


 genlog

  Parse a MariaDB general log file.  General logs lack a lot of "ATTRIBUTES",
  notably ``Query_time``.  The default :option:`--order-by` for general logs
  changes to ``Query_time:cnt``.


 slowlog

  Parse a log file in any variation of MariaDB slow log format.


 tcpdump

  Inspect network packets and decode the MariaDB client protocol, extracting queries
  and responses from it.

  :program:`mariadb-query-digest` does not actually watch the network (i.e. it does NOT "sniff
  packets").  Instead, it's just parsing the output of tcpdump.  You are
  responsible for generating this output; :program:`mariadb-query-digest` does not do it for you.
  Then you send this to :program:`mariadb-query-digest` as you would any log file: as files on the
  command line or to STDIN.

  The parser expects the input to be formatted with the following options: ``-x -n
  -q -tttt``.  For example, if you want to capture output from your local machine,
  you can do something like the following (the port must come last on FreeBSD):

  .. code-block:: bash

     tcpdump -s 65535 -x -nn -q -tttt -i any -c 1000 port 3306 \
       > mariadb.tcp.txt
     :program:`mariadb-query-digest` --type tcpdump mariadb.tcp.txt

  The other tcpdump parameters, such as -s, -c, and -i, are up to you.  Just make
  sure the output looks like this (there is a line break in the first line to
  avoid man-page problems):

  .. code-block:: bash

     2009-04-12 09:50:16.804849 IP 127.0.0.1.42167
            > 127.0.0.1.3306: tcp 37
         0x0000:  4508 0059 6eb2 4000 4006 cde2 7f00 0001
         0x0010:  ....

  Remember tcpdump has a handy -c option to stop after it captures some number of
  packets!  That's very useful for testing your tcpdump command.  Note that
  tcpdump can't capture traffic on a Unix socket.  Read
  `http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31577 <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31577>`_ if you're confused about this.

  Devananda Van Der Veen explained on the MySQL Performance Blog how to capture
  traffic without dropping packets on busy servers.  Dropped packets cause
  :program:`mariadb-query-digest` to miss the response to a request, then see the response to a
  later request and assign the wrong execution time to the query.  You can change
  the filter to something like the following to help capture a subset of the
  queries.  (See `http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/?p=6092 <http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/?p=6092>`_ for details.)

  .. code-block:: bash

     tcpdump -i any -s 65535 -x -n -q -tttt \
        'port 3306 and tcp[1] & 7 == 2 and tcp[3] & 7 == 2'

  All MariaDB servers running on port 3306 are automatically detected in the
  tcpdump output.  Therefore, if the tcpdump out contains packets from
  multiple servers on port 3306 (for example, 10.0.0.1:3306, 10.0.0.2:3306,
  etc.), all packets/queries from all these servers will be analyzed
  together as if they were one server.

  If you're analyzing traffic for a MariaDB server that is not running on port
  3306, see :option:`--watch-server`.

  Also note that :program:`mariadb-query-digest` may fail to report the database for queries
  when parsing tcpdump output.  The database is discovered only in the initial
  connect events for a new client or when <USE db> is executed.  If the tcpdump
  output contains neither of these, then :program:`mariadb-query-digest` cannot discover the
  database.

  Server-side prepared statements are supported.  SSL-encrypted traffic cannot be
  inspected and decoded.


 rawlog

  Raw logs are not MariaDB logs but simple text files with one SQL statement
  per line, like:

  .. code-block:: bash

     SELECT c FROM t WHERE id=1
     /* Hello, world! */ SELECT * FROM t2 LIMIT 1
     INSERT INTO t (a, b) VALUES ('foo', 'bar')
     INSERT INTO t SELECT * FROM monkeys

  Since raw logs do not have any metrics, many options and features of
  :program:`mariadb-query-digest` do not work with them.

  One use case for raw logs is ranking queries by count when the only
  information available is a list of queries, from polling ``SHOW PROCESSLIST``
  for example.


.. option:: --until

 type: string

 Parse only queries older than this value (parse queries until this date).

 This option allows you to ignore queries newer than a certain value and parse
 only those queries which are older than the value.  The value can be one of
 the same types listed for :option:`--since`.

 Unlike :option:`--since`, :option:`--until` is not strict: all queries are parsed until
 one has a timestamp that is equal to or greater than :option:`--until`.  Then
 all subsequent queries are ignored.

.. option:: --user

 short form: -u; type: string

 User for login if not current user.

.. option:: --variations

 type: Array

 Report the number of variations in these attributes' values.

 Variations show how many distinct values an attribute had within a class.
 The usual value for this option is ``arg`` which shows how many distinct queries
 were in the class.  This can be useful to determine a query's cacheability.

 Distinct values are determined by CRC32 checksums of the attributes' values.
 These checksums are reported in the query report for attributes specified by
 this option, like:

 .. code-block:: bash

    # arg crc      109 (1/25%), 144 (1/25%)... 2 more

 In that class there were 4 distinct queries.  The checksums of the first two
 variations are shown, and each one occurred once (or, 25% of the time).

 The counts of distinct variations is approximate because only 1,000 variations
 are saved.  The mod (%) 1000 of the full CRC32 checksum is saved, so some
 distinct checksums are treated as equal.

.. option:: --version

 Show version and exit.

.. option:: --[no]vertical-format

 default: yes

 Output a trailing "\G" in the reported SQL queries.

 This makes the mariadb client display the result using vertical format.
 Non-native MariaDB clients like phpMyAdmin do not support this.

.. option:: --watch-server

 type: string

 This option tells :program:`mariadb-query-digest` which server IP address and port (like
 "10.0.0.1:3306") to watch when parsing tcpdump (for :option:`--type` tcpdump);
 all other servers are ignored.  If you don't specify it,
 :program:`mariadb-query-digest` watches all servers by looking for any IP address using port
 3306 or "mariadb".  If you're watching a server with a non-standard port, this
 won't work, so you must specify the IP address and port to watch.

 If you want to watch a mix of servers, some running on standard port 3306
 and some running on non-standard ports, you need to create separate
 tcpdump outputs for the non-standard port servers and then specify this
 option for each.  At present :program:`mariadb-query-digest` cannot auto-detect servers on
 port 3306 and also be told to watch a server on a non-standard port.

DSN OPTIONS
===========

These DSN options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like
``option=value``.  The options are case-sensitive, so P and p are not the
same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after the ``=`` and
if the value contains whitespace it must be quoted.  DSN options are
comma-separated.  See the mariadb-tools manpage for full details.

* A

 dsn: charset; copy: yes

 Default character set.

* D

 dsn: database; copy: yes

 Default database to use when connecting to MariaDB.

* F

 dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

 Only read default options from the given file.

* h

 dsn: host; copy: yes

 Connect to host.

* p

 dsn: password; copy: yes

 Password to use when connecting.
 If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash: "exam\,ple"

* P

 dsn: port; copy: yes

 Port number to use for connection.

* S

 dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

 Socket file to use for connection.

* t

 The :option:`--review` or :option:`--history` table.

* u

 dsn: user; copy: yes

 User for login if not current user.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

The environment variable ``PTDEBUG`` enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.
To enable debugging and capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

.. code-block:: bash

    PTDEBUG=1 mariadb-query-digest ... > FILE 2>&1

Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes
of output.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be
installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.

ATTRIBUTES REFERENCE
====================

Events may have the following attributes.  If writing a :option:`--filter`,
be sure to check that an attribute is defined in each event before
using it, else the filter code may crash the tool with a
"use of uninitialized value" error.

You can dump event attributes for any input like:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mariadb-query-digest                  \
       slow.log                       \
       --filter 'print Dumper $event' \
       --no-report                    \
       --sample 1

That will produce a lot of output with "attribute => value" pairs like:

.. code-block:: bash

    $VAR1 = {
      Query_time => '0.033384',
      Rows_examined => '0',
      Rows_sent => '0',
      Thread_id => '10',
      Tmp_table => 'No',
      Tmp_table_on_disk => 'No',
      arg => 'SELECT col FROM tbl WHERE id=5',
      bytes => 103,
      cmd => 'Query',
      db => 'db1',
      fingerprint => 'select col from tbl where id=?',
      host => '',
      pos_in_log => 1334,
      ts => '071218 11:48:27',
      user => '[SQL_SLAVE]'
    };

COMMON
======

These attribute are common to all input :option:`--type` and :option:`--processlist`,
except where noted.

arg

 The query text, or the command for admin commands like ``Ping``.

bytes

 The byte length of the ``arg``.

cmd

 "Query" or "Admin".

db

 The current database.  The value comes from USE database statements.  
 By default, ``Schema`` is an alias which is automatically
 changed to ``db``; see :option:`--attribute-aliases`.

fingerprint

 An abstracted form of the query.  See "FINGERPRINTS".

host

 Client host which executed the query.

pos_in_log

 The byte offset of the event in the log or tcpdump,
 except for :option:`--processlist`.

Query_time

 The total time the query took, including lock time.

ts

 The timestamp of when the query ended.

SLOW, GENERAL, AND BINARY LOGS
==============================

Events have all available attributes from the log file.  Therefore, you only
need to look at the log file to see which events are available, but remember:
not all events have the same attributes.

TCPDUMP
=======

These attributes are available when parsing :option:`--type` tcpdump.

Error_no

 The MariaDB error number if the query caused an error.

ip

 The client's IP address.  Certain log files may also contain this attribute.

No_good_index_used

 Yes or No if no good index existed for the query (flag set by server).

No_index_used

 Yes or No if the query did not use any index (flag set by server).

port

 The client's port number.

Warning_count

 The number of warnings, as otherwise shown by ``SHOW WARNINGS``.

PROCESSLIST
===========

If using :option:`--processlist`, an ``id`` attribute is available for
the process ID, in addition to the common attributes.
