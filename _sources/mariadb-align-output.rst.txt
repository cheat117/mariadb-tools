NAME
====

:program:`mariadb-align-output` - Align output from other tools to columns.

SYNOPSIS
========

Usage
-----

::

  mariadb-align-output [FILES]

:program:`mariadb-align-output` aligns output from other tools to columns.  If no FILES are specified,
STDIN is read.

If a tool prints the following output,

.. code-block:: bash

    DATABASE TABLE   ROWS
    foo      bar      100
    long_db_name table  1
    another  long_name 500

then :program:`mariadb-align-output` reprints the output as,

.. code-block:: bash

    DATABASE     TABLE     ROWS
    foo          bar        100
    long_db_name table        1
    another      long_name  500

RISKS
=====

:program:`mariadb-align-output` is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested,
but all database tools can pose a risk to the system and the database
server.  Before using this tool, please:

* Read the tool's documentation

* Review the tool's known "BUGS"

* Test the tool on a non-production server

* Backup your production server and verify the backups

DESCRIPTION
===========

:program:`mariadb-align-output` reads lines and splits them into words.  It counts how many
words each line has, and if there is one number that predominates, it assumes
this is the number of words in each line.  Then it discards all lines that
don't have that many words, and looks at the 2nd line that does.  It assumes
this is the first non-header line.  Based on whether each word looks numeric
or not, it decides on column alignment.  Finally, it goes through and decides
how wide each column should be, and then prints them out.

This is useful for things like aligning the output of vmstat or iostat so it
is easier to read.
